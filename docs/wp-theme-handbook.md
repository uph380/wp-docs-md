# Page Templates <a name="themes/template-files-section/page-template-files" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/

Page templates are a specific type of [template file](#themes/basics/template-files "Template Files") that can be applied to a specific page or groups of pages.

As of WordPress 4.7 page templates support all post types. For more details how to set a page template to specific post types [see example below](#creating-page-templates-for-specific-post-types).

Since a page template is a specific type of template file, here are some distinguishing features of page templates:

- Page templates are used to change the look and feel of a page.
- A page template can be applied to a single page, a page section, or a class of pages.
- Page templates generally have a high level of specificity, targeting an individual page or group of pages. For example, a page template named `page-about.php` is more specific than the template files `page.php` or `index.php` as it will only affect a page with the slug of “about.”
- If a page template has a template name, WordPress users editing the page have control over what template will be used to render the page.

## Uses for Page Templates

Page templates display your site’s dynamic content on a page, e.g., posts, news updates, calendar events, media files, etc. You may decide that you want your homepage to look a specific way, that is quite different to other parts of your site. Or, you may want to display a featured image that links to a post on one part of the page, have a list of latest posts elsewhere, and use a custom navigation. You can use page templates to achieve these things.

This section shows you how to build page templates that can be selected by your users through their admin screens.

For example, you can build page templates for:

- full-width, one-column
- two-column with a sidebar on the right
- two-column with a sidebar on the left
- three-column

## Page Templates within the Template Hierarchy

When a person browses to your website, WordPress selects which template to use for rendering that page. As we learned earlier in the [Template Hierarchy](#themes/basics/template-hierarchy "Template Hierarchy"), WordPress looks for template files in the following order:

1. **Page Template —** If the page has a custom template assigned, WordPress looks for that file and, if found, uses it.
2. **`page-{slug}.php` —** If no custom template has been assigned, WordPress looks for and uses a specialized template that contains the page’s slug.
3. **`page-{id}.php` —** If a specialized template that includes the page’s slug is not found, WordPress looks for and uses a specialized template named with the page’s ID.
4. **`page.php` —** If a specialized template that includes the page’s ID is not found, WordPress looks for and uses the theme’s default page template.
5. **`singular.php` —** If `page.php` is not found, WordPress looks for and uses the theme’s template used for a single post, irregardless of post type.
6. **`index.php` —** If no specific page templates are assigned or found, WordPress defaults back to using the theme’s index file to render pages.

There is also a WordPress-defined template named `paged.php`. It is *not* used for the page post-type but rather for displaying multiple pages of archives.

## Page Templates Purpose &amp; User Control

If you plan on making a custom page template for your theme, you should decide a couple of things before proceeding:

- Whether the page template will be for one specific page or for any page; and
- What type of user control you want available for the template.

Every page template that has a template name can be selected by a user when they create or edit a page. The list of available templates can be found at **Pages &gt; Add New &gt; Attributes &gt; Template**. Therefore, a WordPress user can choose any page template with a template name, which might not be your intention.

For example, if you want to have a specific template for your “About” page, it might not be appropriate to name that page template “About Template” as it would be globally available to all pages (i.e. the user could apply it to any page). Instead, [create a single use template](#themes/template-files-section/page-template-files) and WordPress will render the page with the appropriate template, whenever a user visits the “About” page.

Conversely, many themes include the ability to choose how many columns a page will have. Each of these options is a page template that is available globally. To give your WordPress users this global option, you will need to create page templates for each option and give each a template name.

Dictating whether a template is for global use vs. singular use is achieved by the way the file is named and whether or not is has a specific comment.

Sometimes it is appropriate to have a template globally available even if it appears to be a single use case. When you’re creating themes for release, it can be hard to predict what a user will name their pages. Portfolio pages are a great example as not every WordPress user will name their portfolio the same thing or have the same page ID and yet they may want to use that template.

## File Organization of Page Templates

As discussed in [Organizing Theme Files](#themes/basics/organizing-theme-files), WordPress recognizes the subfolder **page-templates**. Therefore, it’s a good idea to store your global page templates in this folder to help keep them organized.

A specialized page template file (those created for only one time use) **cannot** be in a sub-folder, nor, if using a [Child Theme](#themes/advanced-topics/child-themes), in the Parent Theme’s folder.

## Creating Custom Page Templates for Global Use

Sometimes you’ll want a template that can be used globally by any page, or by multiple pages. Some developers will group their templates with a filename prefix, such as `page_two-columns.php`

***Important!*** Do not use `page-` as a prefix, as WordPress will interpret the file as a specialized template, meant to apply to only *one* page on your site.

For information on theme file-naming conventions and filenames you cannot use, see [reserved theme filenames](#themes/basics/template-files#common-wordpress-template-files "Theme Development").

A quick, safe method for creating a new page template is to make a copy of `page.php` and give the new file a distinct filename. That way, you start off with the HTML structure of your other pages and you can edit the new file as needed.

To create a global template, write an opening PHP comment at the top of the file that states the template’s name.

```php
<?php /* Template Name: Example Template */ ?>
```

It’s a good idea to choose a name that describes what the template does as the name is visible to WordPress users when they are editing the page. For example, you could name your template Homepage, Blog, or Portfolio.

This example from the TwentyFourteen theme creates a page template called Full Width Page:

```php
<?php
/**
* Template Name: Full Width Page
*
* @package WordPress
* @subpackage Twenty_Fourteen
* @since Twenty Fourteen 1.0
*/
```

![basics-page-templates-03](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/basics-page-templates-03.png?resize=180%2C212&ssl=1)Once you upload the file to your theme’s folder (e.g., page-templates), go to the **Page &gt; Edit** screen in your admin dashboard.

On the right hand side under **attributes** you’ll see **template**. This is where users are able to access your global page templates.

The select list has a maximum width of 250px, so longer names may be cut off.

## Creating a Custom Page Template for One Specific Page

As mentioned in the [Template Hierarchy](#themes/basics/template-hierarchy "Template Hierarchy") page, you can create a template for a specific page. To create a template for one specific page, copy your existing `page.php` file and rename it with your page’s slug or ID:

1. `page-{slug}.php`
2. `page-{ID}.php`

For example: Your About page has a slug of ‘about’ and an ID of 6. If your active theme’s folder has a file named `page-about.php` or `page-6.php`, then WordPress will automatically find and use that file to render the About page.

To be used, specialized page templates must be in your theme’s folder (i.e. **/wp-content/themes/my-theme-name/** ).

## Creating page templates for specific post types

By default, a custom page template will be available to the “page” post type.

To create a page template to specific post types, add a line under the template name with the post types you would like the template to support.

Example:

```php
<?php
/*
Template Name: Full-width layout
Template Post Type: post, page, event
*/
// Page code here...
```

This ability to add page templates to post types other than “page” post type is supported only from WordPress 4.7

When at least one template exists for a post type, the ‘Post Attributes’ meta box will be displayed in the back end, without the need to add post type support for ‘page-attributes’ or anything else. The ‘Post Attributes’ label can be customzied per post type using the ‘attributes’ label when registering a post type.

**Backward Compatibility:**

Let’s say you want to publicly release a theme with support for post type templates. WordPress versions before 4.7 will ignore the Template Post Type header and show the template in the list of page templates, even though it only works for regular posts. To prevent that, you can hook into the theme\_page\_templates filter to exclude it from the list. Here’s an example:

```php
/**
 * Hides the custom post template for pages on WordPress 4.6 and older
 *
 * @param array $post_templates Array of page templates. Keys are filenames, values are translated names.
 * @return array Filtered array of page templates.
 */
function makewp_exclude_page_templates( $post_templates ) {
	if ( version_compare( $GLOBALS['wp_version'], '4.7', '&lt;' ) ) {
		unset( $post_templates['templates/my-full-width-post-template.php'] );
	}
	return $post_templates;
}

add_filter( 'theme_page_templates', 'makewp_exclude_page_templates' );
```

That way you can support custom post type templates in WordPress 4.7 and beyond while maintaining full backward compatibility.

Note that theme\_page\_templates is actually a dynamic theme\_{$post\_type}\_templates filter. The dynamic portion of the hook name, $post\_type, refers to the post type supported by the templates. E.g. you can hook into theme\_product\_templates to filter the list of templates for the product post type.

## Using Conditional Tags in Page Templates

You can make smaller, page-specific changes with [Conditional Tags](#themes/basics/conditional-tags) in your theme’s `page.php` file. For instance, the below example code loads the file `header-home.php` for your front page, but loads another file (`header-about.php`) for your About page, and then applies the default `header.php` for all other pages.

```php
if ( is_front_page() ) :
	get_header( 'home' );
elseif ( is_page( 'About' ) ) :
	get_header( 'about' );
else:
	get_header();
endif;
```

[You can learn more about Conditional Tags here.](#themes/basics/conditional-tags)

## Identifying a Page Template

If your template uses the `<a href="#reference/functions/body_class">body_class()</a>` function, WordPress will print classes in the `body` tag for the post type class name (`page`), the page’s ID (`page-id-{ID}`), and the page template used. For the default `page.php`, the class name generated is `page-template-default`:

```markup
<body class="page page-id-6 page-template-default">
```

A specialized template (`page-{slug}.php` or `page-{ID}.php`) also gets the `page-template-default` class rather than its own body class.

When using a custom page template, the class `page-template` will print, along with a class naming the specific template. For example, if your custom page template file is named as follows:

```php
<?php
/* Template Name: My Custom Page */
?>
```

Then then rendered HTML generated will be as follows:

```markup
<body class="page page-id-6 page-template page-template-my-custom-page-php">
```

Notice the `page-template-my-custom-page-php` class that is applied to the `body` tag.

## Page Template Functions

These built-in WordPress functions and methods can help you work with page templates:

- `<a href="#reference/functions/get_page_template">get_page_template()</a>` returns the path of the page template used to render the page.
- `<a href="#reference/classes/wp_theme/get_page_templates">wp_get_theme()->get_page_templates()</a>` returns all custom page templates available to the currently active theme (`get_page_templates()` is a method of the `<a href="#reference/classes/wp_theme">WP_Theme</a>` class).
- `<a href="#reference/functions/is_page_template">is_page_template()</a>` returns true or false depending on whether a custom page template was used to render the page.
- `<a href="#reference/functions/get_page_template_slug">get_page_template_slug()</a>` returns the value of custom field `_wp_page_template` (`null` when the value is empty or “default”).If a page has been assigned a custom template, the filename of that template is stored as the value of a [custom field](https://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields "Custom Fields") named `'_wp_page_template'` (in the [`wp_postmeta`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description#Table:_wp_postmeta "Database Description") database table). (Custom fields starting with an underscore do not display in the edit screen’s custom fields module.)

# Template Hierarchy <a name="themes/basics/template-hierarchy" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/

As discussed, [template files](#themes/basics/template-files "Template files page") are modular, reusable files, used to generate the web pages on your WordPress site. Some template files (such as the header and footer template) are used on all of your site’s pages, while others are used only under specific conditions.

This article explains **how WordPress determines which template file(s) to use on individual pages**. If you want to customize an existing WordPress theme it will help you decide which template file needs to be edited.

You can also use [Conditional Tags](#themes/basics/conditional-tags "Conditional Tags") to control which templates are loaded on a specific page.

## The Template File Hierarchy

### Overview

WordPress uses the [query string](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary/#query-string) to decide which template or set of templates should be used to display the page. The query string is information that is contained in the link to each part of your website.

Put simply, WordPress searches down through the template hierarchy until it finds a matching template file. To determine which template file to use, WordPress:

1. Matches every query string to a query type to decide which page is being requested (for example, a search page, a category page, etc);
2. Selects the template in the order determined by the template hierarchy;
3. Looks for template files with specific names in the current theme’s directory and uses the **first matching template file** as specified by the hierarchy.

With the exception of the basic `index.php` template file, you can choose whether you want to implement a particular template file or not.

In these examples, the PHP file extension is used. In block themes, HTML files are used instead, but the template hierarchy is the same.

If WordPress cannot find a template file with a matching name, it will skip to the next file in the hierarchy. If WordPress cannot find any matching template file, the theme’s `index.php` file will be used.

When you are using a [child theme](#themes/advanced-topics/child-themes), any file you add to your child theme will over-ride the same file in the parent theme. For example, both themes contain the same template `category.php`, then child theme’s template is used.  
If a child theme contains the specific template such as `category-unicorns.php` and the parent theme contains lower prioritized template such as `category.php`, then child theme’s `category-unicorns.php` is used.  
Contrary, if a child theme contains general template only such as `category.php` and the parent theme contains the specific one such as `category-unicorns.php`, then parent’s template `category-unicorns.php` is used.

### Examples

If your blog is at `http://example.com/blog/` and a visitor clicks on a link to a category page such as `http://example.com/blog/category/your-cat/`, WordPress looks for a template file in the current theme’s directory that matches the category’s ID to generate the correct page. More specifically, WordPress follows this procedure:

1. Looks for a template file in the current theme’s directory that matches the category’s slug. If the category slug is “unicorns,” then WordPress looks for a template file named `category-unicorns.php`.
2. If `category-unicorns.php` is missing and the category’s ID is 4, WordPress looks for a template file named `category-4.php`.
3. If `category-4.php` is missing, WordPress will look for a generic category template file, `category.php`.
4. If `category.php` does not exist, WordPress will look for a generic archive template, `archive.php`.
5. If `archive.php` is also missing, WordPress will fall back to the main theme template file, `index.php`.

### Visual Overview

The following diagram shows which template files are called to generate a WordPress page based on the WordPress template hierarchy.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/Screenshot-2019-01-23-00.20.04.png?resize=1024%2C639&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/Screenshot-2019-01-23-00.20.04.png?ssl=1)## The Template Hierarchy In Detail

While the template hierarchy is easier to understand as a diagram, the following sections describe the order in which template files are called by WordPress for a number of query types.

### Home Page display

By default, WordPress sets your site’s home page to display your latest blog posts. This page is called the blog posts index. You can also set your blog posts to display on a separate static page. The template file `home.php` is used to render the blog posts index, whether it is being used as the front page or on separate static page. If `home.php` does not exist, WordPress will use `index.php`.

1. `home.php`
2. `index.php`

If `front-page.php` exists, it will override the `home.php` template.

### Front Page display

The `front-page.php` template file is used to render your site’s front page, whether the front page displays the blog posts index (mentioned above) or a static page. The front page template takes precedence over the blog posts index (`home.php`) template. If the `front-page.php` file does not exist, WordPress will either use the `home.php` or `page.php` files depending on the setup in Settings → Reading. If neither of those files exist, it will use the `index.php` file.

1. `front-page.php` – Used for both “**your latest posts**” or “**a static page**” as set in the **front page displays** section of Settings → Reading.
2. `home.php` – If WordPress cannot find `front-page.php` and “**your latest posts**” is set in the **front page displays** section, it will look for `home.php`. Additionally, WordPress will look for this file when the **posts page** is set in the **front page displays** section.
3. `page.php` – When “**front page**” is set in the **front page displays** section.
4. `index.php` – When “**your latest posts**” is set in the **front page displays** section but `home.php` does not exist *or* when **front page** is set but `page.php` does not exist.

As you can see, there are a lot of rules to what path WordPress takes. Using the chart above is the best way to determine what WordPress will display.

### Privacy Policy Page display

The `privacy-policy.php` template file is used to render your site’s Privacy Policy page. The Privacy Policy page template takes precedence over the static page (`page.php`) template. If the `privacy-policy.php` file does not exist, WordPress will either use the `page.php` or `singular.php` files depending on the available templates. If neither of those files exist, it will use the `index.php` file.

1. `privacy-policy.php` – Used for the Privacy Policy page set in the **Change your Privacy Policy page** section of Settings → Privacy.
2. `custom template file` – The [page template](#themes/template-files-section/page-template-files) assigned to the page. See `get_page_templates()`.
3. `page-{slug}.php` – If the page slug is `privacy`, WordPress will look to use `page-privacy.php`.
4. `page-{id}.php` – If the page ID is 6, WordPress will look to use `page-6.php`.
5. `page.php`
6. `singular.php`
7. `index.php`

### Single Post

The single post template file is used to render a single post. WordPress uses the following path:

1. `single-{post-type}-{slug}.php` – (Since 4.4) First, WordPress looks for a template for the specific post. For example, if [post type](#themes/basics/post-types) is `product` and the post slug is `dmc-12`, WordPress would look for `single-product-dmc-12.php`.
2. `single-{post-type}.php` – If the post type is `product`, WordPress would look for `single-product.php`.
3. `single.php` – WordPress then falls back to `single.php`.
4. `singular.php` – Then it falls back to `singular.php`.
5. `index.php` – Finally, as mentioned above, WordPress ultimately falls back to `index.php`.

### Single Page

The template file used to render a static page (`page` post-type). Note that unlike other post-types, `page` is special to WordPress and uses the following path:

1. `custom template file` – The [page template](#themes/template-files-section/page-template-files) assigned to the page. See `<a href="#reference/functions/get_page_templates">get_page_templates()</a>`.
2. `page-{slug}.php` – If the page slug is `recent-news`, WordPress will look to use `page-recent-news.php`.
3. `page-{id}.php` – If the page ID is 6, WordPress will look to use `page-6.php`.
4. `page.php`
5. `singular.php`
6. `index.php`

### Category

Rendering category archive index pages uses the following path in WordPress:

1. `category-{slug}.php` – If the category’s slug is `news`, WordPress will look for `category-news.php`.
2. `category-{id}.php` – If the category’s ID is `6`, WordPress will look for `category-6.php`.
3. `category.php`
4. `archive.php`
5. `index.php`

### Tag

To display a tag archive index page, WordPress uses the following path:

1. `tag-{slug}.php` – If the tag’s slug is `sometag`, WordPress will look for `tag-sometag.php`.
2. `tag-{id}.php` – If the tag’s ID is `6`, WordPress will look for `tag-6.php`.
3. `tag.php`
4. `archive.php`
5. `index.php`

### Custom Taxonomies

[Custom taxonomies](#themes/basics/categories-tags-custom-taxonomies) use a slightly different template file path:

1. `taxonomy-{taxonomy}-{term}.php` – If the taxonomy is `sometax`, and taxonomy’s term is `someterm`, WordPress will look for `taxonomy-sometax-someterm.php.` In the case of [post formats](#themes/functionality/post-formats), the taxonomy is ‘post\_format’ and the terms are ‘post-format-{format}. i.e. `taxonomy-post_format-post-format-link.php` for the link post format.
2. `taxonomy-{taxonomy}.php` – If the taxonomy were `sometax`, WordPress would look for `taxonomy-sometax.php`.
3. `taxonomy.php`
4. `archive.php`
5. `index.php`

### Custom Post Types

[Custom Post Types](#themes/basics/post-types) use the following path to render the appropriate archive index page.

1. `archive-{post_type}.php` – If the post type is `product`, WordPress will look for `archive-product.php`.
2. `archive.php`
3. `index.php`

(For rendering a single post type template, refer to the [single post display](#single-post "Single Post Display") section above.)

### Author display

Based on the above examples, rendering author archive index pages is fairly explanatory:

1. `author-{nicename}.php` – If the author’s nice name is `matt`, WordPress will look for `author-matt.php`.
2. `author-{id}.php` – If the author’s ID were `6`, WordPress will look for `author-6.php`.
3. `author.php`
4. `archive.php`
5. `index.php`

### Date

Date-based archive index pages are rendered as you would expect:

1. `date.php`
2. `archive.php`
3. `index.php`

### Search Result

Search results follow the same pattern as other template types:

1. `search.php`
2. `index.php`

### 404 (Not Found)

Likewise, 404 template files are called in this order:

1. `404.php`
2. `index.php`

### Attachment

Rendering an attachment page (`attachment` post-type) uses the following path:

1. `{MIME-type}.php` – can be any [MIME type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type") (For example: `image.php`, `video.php`, `pdf.php`). For `text/plain`, the following path is used (in order): 
    1. `text-plain.php`
    2. `plain.php`
    3. `text.php`
2. `attachment.php`
3. `single-attachment-{slug}.php` – For example, if the attachment slug is `holiday`, WordPress would look for `single-attachment-holiday.php`.
4. `single-attachment.php`
5. `single.php`
6. `singular.php`
7. `index.php`

As of WordPress 6.4, attachment pages are [no longer enabled by default](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/16/changes-to-attachment-pages/) on new installations. Users can enable them with a plugin, so it is still good practice to test your theme and ensure it properly displays content when viewing an attachment page.

### Embeds

The embed template file is used to render a post which is being embedded. Since 4.5, WordPress uses the following path:

1. `embed-{post-type}-{post_format}.php` – First, WordPress looks for a template for the specific post. For example, if its post type is `post` and it has the audio format, WordPress would look for `embed-post-audio.php`.
2. `embed-{post-type}.php` – If the post type is `product`, WordPress would look for `embed-product.php`.
3. `embed.php` – WordPress then falls back to embed`.php`.
4. Finally, WordPress ultimately falls back to its own `wp-includes/theme-compat/embed.php` template.

## Non-ASCII Character Handling

Since WordPress 4.7, any dynamic part of a template name which includes non-ASCII characters in its name actually supports both the un-encoded and the encoded form, in that order. You can choose which to use.

Here’s the page template hierarchy for a page named “Hello World 😀” with an ID of `6`:

- `page-hello-world-😀.php`
- `page-hello-world-%f0%9f%98%80.php`
- `page-6.php`
- `page.php`
- `singular.php`

The same behaviour applies to post slugs, term names, and author nicenames.

## Filter Hierarchy

The WordPress template system lets you filter the hierarchy. This means that you can insert and change things at specific points of the hierarchy. The filter (located in the [`get_query_template()`](#reference/functions/get_query_template) function) uses this filter name: `"{$type}_template"` where `$type` is the template type.

Here is a list of all available filters in the template hierarchy:

- `embed_template`
- `404_template`
- `search_template`
- `frontpage_template`
- `home_template`
- `privacypolicy_template`
- `taxonomy_template`
- `attachment_template`
- `single_template`
- `page_template`
- `singular_template`
- `category_template`
- `tag_template`
- `author_template`
- `date_template`
- `archive_template`
- `index_template`

### Example

For example, let’s take the default author hierarchy:

- `author-{nicename}.php`
- `author-{id}.php`
- `author.php`

To add `author-{role}.php` before `author.php`, we can manipulate the actual hierarchy using the ‘author\_template’ template type. This allows a request for /author/username where username has the role of editor to display using author-editor.php if present in the current themes directory.

```php
function author_role_template( $templates = '' ) {
	$author = get_queried_object();
	$role   = $author->roles[0];

	if ( ! is_array( $templates ) && ! empty( $templates ) ) {
		$templates = locate_template( array( "author-$role.php", $templates ), false );
	} elseif ( empty( $templates ) ) {
		$templates = locate_template( "author-$role.php", false );
	} else {
		$new_template = locate_template( array( "author-$role.php" ) );

		if ( ! empty( $new_template ) ) {
			array_unshift( $templates, $new_template );
		}
	}
	return $templates;
}
add_filter( 'author_template', 'author_role_template' );
```

Changelog:

- **Updated** 2022-02-15. Added a notice explaining that the template hierarchy is the same for classic and block themes, but that the examples uses .php files and block themes use .html files.

# Template Tags <a name="themes/basics/template-tags" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-tags/

Template tags are used within themes to **retrieve content from your database**. The content could be anything from a blog title to a complete sidebar. Template tags are the preferred method to pull content into your theme because:

- they can print dynamic content;
- they can be used in multiple theme files; and
- they separate the theme into smaller, more understandable, sections.

## What is a Template Tag?

A template tag is simply a piece of code that tells WordPress to get something from the database. It is broken up into three components:

- A PHP code tag
- A WordPress function
- Optional parameters

You can use a template tag to call another theme file or some information from the database.

For example, the template tag `<a href="#reference/functions/get_header">get_header()</a>` tells WordPress to get the `header.php` file and include it in the current theme file. Similarly, `<a href="#reference/functions/get_footer">get_footer()</a>` tells WordPress to get the footer.php file.

There are also other kinds of template tags:

- `<a href="#reference/functions/the_title">the_title()</a>` – tells WordPress to get the title of the page or post from the database and include it.
- `<a href="#reference/functions/bloginfo">bloginfo( 'name' )</a>` – tells WordPress to get the blog title out of the database and include it in the template file.

If you look closely at the last example, you will also see that there is a parameter between the parenthesis. Parameters let you do two things:

1. ask for specific pieces of information and
2. format the information in a certain way.

[Parameters are covered extensively below](#parameters), but it’s useful to be aware that you can send WordPress-specific instructions for how you want the data presented.

## Why Use Template Tags

By encapsulating all of the code for a particular chunk of content, template tags make it very easy to include various pieces of a template in a theme file and also to maintain the theme.

It is far easier to create one `header.php` file and have all of your theme templates like `single.php`, `page.php`, `front-page.php`, etc. reference that one theme file using `<a href="#reference/functions/get_header">get_header()</a>` than copying and pasting the code into each theme file. It also makes maintenance easier. Whenever you make a change in your `header.php` file, the change is automatically carried over into all of your other theme files.

Another reason to use template tags is to display dynamic data, i.e. data from the database. In your header, you could manually include the `title` tag, like so:

```xml
<title>My Personal Website</title>
```

However, doing this means manually editing your theme any time you want to change the title of your website. Instead, it’s easier to include the `<a href="#reference/functions/bloginfo">bloginfo( 'name' )</a>` template tag, which automatically fetch the site title from the database. Now, you can change the title of your site in WordPress, rather than having to hard code your theme templates.

## How to Use Template Tags

Using template tags is very simple. In any template file you can use a template tag by simply printing one line of php code to call the template tag. Printing the header.php file is as simple as:

```php
get_header();
```

### Parameters

Some template tags let you pass parameters. Parameters are extra pieces of information that determine what is retrieved from the database.

For example, the `<a href="#reference/functions/bloginfo" title="bloginfo template tag">bloginfo()</a>` template tag allows you to give it a parameter telling WordPress the specific piece of information you want. To print the blog name, you just pass along the parameter “name,” like so:

```php
bloginfo( 'name' );
```

To print the version of WordPress that the blog is running on, you would pass a parameter of “version”:

```php
bloginfo( 'version' );
```

For each template tag, the parameters differ. A list of the parameters and what they can do can be found on specific template tag pages located throughout the [code reference](#reference).

### Using Template Tags Within the Loop

Many template tags work within the [WordPress Loop](#themes/basics/the-loop). This means that they are included in the template files as part of the php “loop” that generates the pages users see based upon the instructions inside of the loop.

The WordPress loop begins with:

```php
if ( have_posts() ) :
	while ( have_posts() ) :
		the_post();
```

Template tags that work within the loop must be in the middle area, before the ending section of the loop below:

```php
	endwhile;
else :
	_e( 'Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.', 'devhub' );
endif;
```

Some of template tags that need to be inside of the loop include

- [the\_content()](#referencefunctions/the_content/)
- [the\_excerpt()](#referencefunctions/the_excerpt/)
- [next\_post()](#referencefunctions/next_post/)
- [previous\_post()](#referencefunctions/previous_post/)

The main reason why some functions require the loop is because they require the global post object to be set.

If the template tag you want to use doesn’t have to be within the loop

- [wp\_list\_cats()](#referencefunctions/wp_list_cats/)
- [wp\_list\_pages()](#referencefunctions/wp_list_pages/)

then you can put it in any file you’d like, for instance in the sidebar, header, or footer template files.

These are functions that typically do not require the global post object.

# The Loop <a name="themes/basics/the-loop" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/the-loop/

The Loop is the default mechanism WordPress uses for outputting posts through a theme’s [template files](#themes/basics/template-files). How many posts are retrieved is determined by the number of posts to show per page defined in the Reading settings. Within the Loop, WordPress retrieves each post to be displayed on the current page and formats it according to your theme’s instructions.

The Loop extracts the data for each post from the WordPress database and inserts the appropriate information in place of each [template tag](#themes/basics/template-tags). Any HTML or PHP code in The Loop will be processed **for each post**.

To put it simply, the Loop is true to its name: it loops through each post retrieved for the current page one at a time and performs the action specified in your theme.

You can use the Loop for a number of different things, for example to:

- display post titles and excerpts on your blog’s homepage;
- display the content and comments on a single post;
- display the content on an individual page using template tags; and
- display data from [Custom Post Types](#themes/functionality/pages-posts-custom-post-types) and Custom Fields.

You can customize the Loop across your template files to display and manipulate different content.

## The Loop in Detail

The basic loop is:

```php
<?php
if ( have_posts() ) :
    while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
        // Display post content
    endwhile;
endif;
?>
```

This loop says that when there are posts, loop through and display the posts. Broken down into more detail:

- The `<a href="#reference/functions/have_posts">have_posts()</a>` function checks whether there are any posts.
- If there are posts, a **`while`** loop continues to execute as long as the condition in the parenthesis is logically true. As long as `have_posts()` continues to be true, the loop will continue.

### Using The Loop

The Loop should be placed in `index.php`, and in any other templates which are used to display post information. Because you do not want to duplicate your header over and over, the loop should always be placed after the call to `<a href="#reference/functions/get_header">get_header()</a>`. For example:

```php
<?php
get_header();
if ( have_posts() ) :
    while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
        // Display post content
    endwhile;
endif;
?>
```

In the above example, the end of the Loop is shown with an `endwhile` and `endif`. The Loop must always begin with the same `if` and `while` statements, as mentioned above and must end with the same end statements.

Any [template tags](#themes/basics/template-tags) that you wish to apply to all posts must exist between the beginning and ending statements.

 You can include a custom 404 “not found” message that will be displayed if no posts matching the specified criteria are available. The message must be placed between the `endwhile` and `endif` statements, as seen in examples below.

An extremely simple `index.php` file would look like:

```php
<?php
get_header();

if ( have_posts() ) :
    while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
        the_content();
    endwhile;
else :
    _e( 'Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.', 'textdomain' );
endif;

get_sidebar();
get_footer();
?>
```

## What the Loop Can Display

The Loop can display a number of different elements for each post. For example, some common [template tags](#themes/basics/template-tags "Template Tags") used in many themes are:

- `<a href="#reference/functions/next_post_link">next_post_link()</a>` – a link to the post published chronologically *after* the current post
- `<a href="#reference/functions/previous_post_link">previous_post_link()</a>` – a link to the post published chronologically *before* the current post
- `<a href="#reference/functions/the_category">the_category()</a>` – the category or categories associated with the post or page being viewed
- `<a href="#reference/functions/the_author">the_author()</a>` – the author of the post or page
- `<a href="#reference/functions/the_content">the_content()</a>` – the main content for a post or page
- `<a href="#reference/functions/the_excerpt">the_excerpt()</a>` – the first 55 words of a post’s main content followed by an ellipsis (…) or read more link that goes to the full post. You may also use the “Excerpt” field of a post to customize the length of a particular excerpt.
- `<a href="#reference/functions/the_id">the_ID()</a>` – the ID for the post or page
- `<a href="#reference/functions/the_meta">the_meta()</a>` – the custom fields associated with the post or page
- `<a href="#reference/functions/the_shortlink">the_shortlink()</a>` – a link to the page or post using the url of the site and the ID of the post or page
- `<a href="#reference/functions/the_tags">the_tags()</a>` – the tag or tags associated with the post
- `<a href="#reference/functions/the_title">the_title()</a>` – the title of the post or page
- `<a href="#reference/functions/the_time">the_time()</a>` – the time or date for the post or page. This can be customized using standard php date function formatting.

You can also use [conditional tags](#themes/basics/conditional-tags), such as:

- `<a href="#reference/functions/is_home">is_home()</a>` – Returns true if the current page is the homepage
- `<a href="#reference/functions/is_admin">is_admin()</a>` – Returns true if inside Administration Screen, false otherwise
- `<a href="#reference/functions/is_single">is_single()</a>` – Returns true if the page is currently displaying a single post
- `<a href="#reference/functions/is_page">is_page()</a>` – Returns true if the page is currently displaying a single page
- `<a href="#reference/functions/is_page_template">is_page_template()</a>` – Can be used to determine if a page is using a specific template, for example: `is_page_template('about-page.php')`
- `<a href="#reference/functions/is_category">is_category()</a>` – Returns true if page or post has the specified category, for example: `is_category('news')`
- `<a href="#reference/functions/is_tag">is_tag()</a>` – Returns true if a page or post has the specified tag
- `<a href="#reference/functions/is_author">is_author()</a>` – Returns true if inside author’s archive page
- `<a href="#reference/functions/is_search">is_search()</a>` – Returns true if the current page is a search results page
- `<a href="#reference/functions/is_404">is_404()</a>` – Returns true if the current page does not exist
- `<a href="#reference/functions/has_excerpt">has_excerpt()</a>` – Returns true if the post or page has an excerpt

## Examples

Let’s take a look at some examples of the Loop in action:

### Basic Examples

#### Blog Archive

Most blogs have a blog archive page, which can show a number of things including the post title, thumbnail, and excerpt. The example below shows a simple loop that checks to see if there are any posts and, if there are, outputs each post’s title, thumbnail, and excerpt. If no posts exists, it displays the message in parentheses.

```php
<?php
if ( have_posts() ) :
    while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
        the_title( '<h2>', '</h2>' );
        the_post_thumbnail();
        the_excerpt();
    endwhile;
else:
    _e( 'Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.', 'textdomain' );
endif;
?>
```

#### Individual Post

In WordPress, each post has its own page, which displays the relevant information for that post. Template tags allow you to customize which information you want to display.

In the example below, the loop outputs the post’s title and content. You could use this example in a post or page template file to display the most basic information about the post. You could also customize this template to add more data to the post, for example the category.

```php
<?php
if ( have_posts() ) :
    while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
        the_title( '<h1>', '</h1>' );
        the_content();
    endwhile;
else:
    _e( 'Sorry, no pages matched your criteria.', 'textdomain' );
endif;
?>
```

### Intermediate Examples

#### Style Posts from Some Categories Differently

The example below does a couple of things:

- First, it displays each post with its title, time, author, content, and category, similar to the individual post example above.
- Next, it makes it possible for posts with the category ID of “3” to be styled differently, utilizing the `<a href="#reference/functions/in_category">in_category()</a>` template tag.

Code comments in this example provide details throughout each stage of the loop:

```php
<?php
// Start the Loop.
if ( have_posts() ) :
    while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
        /* * See if the current post is in category 3.
          * If it is, the div is given the CSS class "post-category-three".
          * Otherwise, the div is given the CSS class "post".
        */
        if ( in_category( 3 ) ) : ?>
        <div class="post-category-three">
        <?php else : ?>
        <div class="post">
        <?php endif; 

            // Display the post's title.
            the_title( '<h2>', ';</h2>' ); 

            // Display a link to other posts by this posts author.
            printf( __( 'Posted by %s', 'textdomain' ), get_the_author_posts_link() );

            // Display the post's content in a div.
            ?>
            <div class="entry">
                <?php the_content() ?>
             </div>

            <?php
            // Display a comma separated list of the post's categories.
            _e( 'Posted in ', 'textdomain' ); the_category( ', ' ); 

        // closes the first div box with the class of "post" or "post-cat-three"
       ?>
       </div>

    <?php
    // Stop the Loop, but allow for a "if not posts" situation
    endwhile; 

else :
    /*
      * The very first "if" tested to see if there were any posts to
      * display. This "else" part tells what do if there weren't any.
     */
     _e( 'Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.', 'textdomain' );

// Completely stop the Loop.
 endif;
?>
```

## Multiple Loops

In some situations, you may need to use more than one loop. For example you may want to display the titles of the posts in a table of content list at the top of the page and then display the content further down the page. Since the query isn’t being changed we simply need to rewind the loop when we need to loop through the posts for a second time. For that we will use the function [rewind\_posts()](#reference/functions/rewind_posts) .

### Using rewind\_posts

You can use `<a href="#reference/functions/rewind_posts">rewind_posts()</a>` to loop through the *same* query a second time. This is useful if you want to display the same query twice in different locations on a page.

Here is an example of `rewind_posts()` in use:

```php
<?php
// Start the main loop
if ( have_posts() ) :
    while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
        the_title();
    endwhile;
endif;

// Use rewind_posts() to use the query a second time.
rewind_posts();

// Start a new loop
while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
    the_content();
endwhile;
?>
```

### Creating secondary queries and loops

Using two loops with the same query was relatively easy but not always what you will need. Instead, you will often want to create a secondary query to display different content on the template. For example, you might want to display two groups of posts on the same page, but do different things to each group. A common example of this, as shown below, is displaying a single post with a list of posts from the same category below the single post.

```php
<?php
// The main query.
if ( have_posts() ) :
    while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
        the_title();
        the_content();
    endwhile;
else :
    // When no posts are found, output this text.
    _e( 'Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.' );
endif;
wp_reset_postdata();                                                        

/*
 * The secondary query. Note that you can use any category name here. In our example,
 * we use "example-category".
 */
$secondary_query = new WP_Query( 'category_name=example-category' );        

// The second loop.
if ( $secondary_query->have_posts() )
    echo '<ul>';
    while ( $secondary_query->have_posts() ) : $secondary_query->the_post();
        the_title( '<li>', '</li>' );
     endwhile;
     echo '</ul>';
endif;
wp_reset_postdata();
?>
```

As you can see in the example above, we first display a regular loop. Then we define a new variable that uses `<a href="#reference/classes/wp_query">WP_Query</a>` to query a specific category; in our case, we chose the `example-category` slug.

Note that the regular loop in the example above has one difference: it calls `<a href="#reference/functions/wp_reset_postdata">wp_reset_postdata()</a>` to reset the post data. Before you can use a second loop, you need to reset the post data. There are two ways to do this:

1. By using the `<a href="#reference/functions/rewind_posts">rewind_posts()</a>` function; or
2. By creating new query objects.

### Resetting multiple loops

It’s important when using multiple loops in a template that you reset them. Not doing so can lead to unexpected results due to how data is stored and used within the ``global `$post` variable. There are three main ways to reset the loop depending on the way they are called.

- ```<a href="#reference/functions/wp_reset_postdata">wp_reset_postdata()</a>`
- `<a href="#reference/functions/wp_reset_query">wp_reset_query()</a>`
- `<a href="#reference/functions/rewind_posts">rewind_posts()</a>`

### Using wp\_reset\_postdata

Use `<a href="#reference/functions/wp_reset_postdata">wp_reset_postdata()</a>` when you are running custom or multiple loops with `WP_Query`. This function restores the global `$post` variable to the current post in the main query. If you’re following best practices, this is the most common function you will use to reset loops.

To properly use this function, place the following code after any loops with `WP_Query`:

```php
<?php wp_reset_postdata(); ?>
```

Here is an example of a loop using `WP_Query` that is reset with `<a href="#reference/functions/wp_reset_postdata">wp_reset_postdata()</a>`.

```php
 <?php
// Example argument that defines three posts per page.
$args = array( 'posts_per_page' => 3 ); 

// Variable to call WP_Query.
$the_query = new WP_Query( $args ); 

if ( $the_query->have_posts() ) :
    // Start the Loop
    while ( $the_query->have_posts() ) : $the_query->the_post();
        the_title();
        the_excerpt();
    // End the Loop
    endwhile;
else:
// If no posts match this query, output this text.
    _e( 'Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.', 'textdomain' );
endif; 

wp_reset_postdata();
?> 
```

### Using wp\_reset\_query

Using `<a href="#reference/functions/wp_reset_query">wp_reset_query()</a>` restores the [WP\_Query](#reference/classes/wp_query) and global `$post` data to the original main query. You **MUST** use this function to reset your loop if you use `<a href="#reference/functions/query_posts">query_posts()</a>` within your loop. You can use it after custom loops with [WP\_Query](#reference/classes/wp_query) because it actually calls `<a href="#reference/functions/wp_reset_postdata">wp_reset_postdata()</a>` when it runs. However, it’s best practice to use `<a href="#reference/functions/wp_reset_postdata">wp_reset_postdata()</a>` with any custom loops involving `WP_Query`.

 `<a href="#reference/functions/query_posts">query_posts()</a>` is *not best practice* and should be avoided if at all possible. Therefore, you shouldn’t have much use for `<a href="#reference/functions/wp_reset_query">wp_reset_query()</a>`.

To properly use this function, place the following code after any loops with `<a href="#reference/functions/query_posts">query_posts()</a>`.

```php
<?php wp_reset_query(); ?>
```

# Theme Functions <a name="themes/basics/theme-functions" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/theme-functions/

`Functions.php` can be used by both classic themes, block themes, and child themes.

The `functions.php` file is where you add unique features to your WordPress theme. It can be used to hook into the core functions of WordPress to make your theme more modular, extensible, and functional.

## What is `functions.php`?

The `functions.php` file behaves like a WordPress plugin, adding features and functionality to a WordPress site. You can use it to call WordPress functions and to define your own functions.

 The same result can be produced using either a plugin or `functions.php`. If you are creating new features that should be available no matter what the website looks like, **it is best practice to put them in a plugin**.

There are advantages and tradeoffs to either using a WordPress plugin or using `functions.php`.

A WordPress plugin:

- requires specific, unique header text;
- is stored in wp-content/plugins, usually in a subdirectory;
- only executes on page load when activated;
- applies to all themes; and
- should have a single purpose – for example, offer search engine optimization features or help with backups.

Meanwhile, a `functions.php` file:

- requires no unique header text;
- is stored in theme’s subdirectory in wp-content/themes;
- executes only when in the active theme’s directory;
- applies only to that theme (if the theme is changed, the features can no longer be used); and
- can have numerous blocks of code used for many different purposes.

Each theme has its own functions file, but only code in the active theme’s `functions.php` is actually run. If your theme already has a functions file, you can add code to it. If not, you can create a plain-text file named `functions.php` to add to your theme’s directory, as explained below.

A [child theme](#themes/advanced-topics/child-themes) can have its own `functions.php` file. Adding a function to the child functions file is a risk-free way to modify a parent theme. That way, when the parent theme is updated, you don’t have to worry about your newly added function disappearing.

Although the child theme’s `functions.php` is loaded by WordPress right before the parent theme’s `functions.php`, it does not *override* it. The child theme’s `functions.php` can be used to augment or replace the parent theme’s functions. Similarly, `functions.php` is loaded *after any plugin files have loaded*.

With `functions.php` you can:

- Use WordPress hooks. For example, with [the `excerpt_length`](#reference/hooks/excerpt_length) filter you can change your post excerpt length (from default of 55 words).
- Enable WordPress features with `<a href="#reference/functions/add_theme_support">add_theme_support()</a>`. For example, turn on post thumbnails, post formats, and navigation menus.
- Define functions you wish to reuse in multiple theme template files.

  
In WordPress, naming conflicts can occur when two or more functions, classes, or variables have the same name. This can cause errors or unexpected behavior in a WordPress site. It is the responsibility of both the theme developer and plugin developer to avoid naming conflicts in their respective code. Theme developers should ensure that their functions, classes, and variables have unique names that do not conflict with those used by WordPress core or other plugins. They should also prefix their function and class names with a unique identifier, such as the theme name or abbreviation, to minimize the chances of a naming conflict.

## Examples

Below are a number of examples that you can use in your functions.php file to support various features. Each of these examples are allowed in your theme if you choose to submit it to the WordPress.org theme directory.

### Theme Setup

A number of theme features should be included within a “setup” function that runs initially when your theme is activated. As shown below, each of these features can be added to your `functions.php` file to activate recommended WordPress features.

It’s important to namespace your functions with your theme name. All examples below use `myfirsttheme_` as their namespace, which should be customized based on your theme name.

To create this initial function, start a new function entitled `myfirsttheme_setup()`, like so:

```php
if ( ! function_exists( 'myfirsttheme_setup' ) ) :
/**
 * Sets up theme defaults and registers support for various WordPress  
 * features.
 *
 * It is important to set up these functions before the init hook so
 * that none of these features are lost.
 *
 *  @since MyFirstTheme 1.0
 */
function myfirsttheme_setup() { ... }
```

Note: In the above example, the function myfirsttheme\_setup is started but not closed out. Be sure to close out your functions.

#### Automatic Feed Links

Automatic feed links enables post and comment RSS feeds by default. These feeds will be displayed in `<head>` automatically. They can be called using `<a href="#reference/functions/add_theme_support">add_theme_support()</a>` in classic themes. This feature is automatically enabled for block themes, and does not need to be included during theme setup.

```php
add_theme_support( 'automatic-feed-links' );
```

#### Navigation Menus

In classic themes, custom [navigation menus](#themes/functionality/navigation-menus "Navigation Menus") allow users to edit and customize menus in the Menus admin panel, giving users a drag-and-drop interface to edit the various menus in their theme.

You can set up multiple menus in `functions.php`. They can be added using `<a href="#reference/functions/register_nav_menus">register_nav_menus()</a>` and inserted into a theme using `<a href="#reference/functions/wp_nav_menu">wp_nav_menu()</a>`, as discussed [later in this handbook](#themes/functionality/navigation-menus). If your theme will allow more than one menu, you should use an array. While some themes will not have custom navigation menus, it is recommended that you allow this feature for easy customization.

```php
register_nav_menus( array(
    'primary'   => __( 'Primary Menu', 'myfirsttheme' ),
    'secondary' => __( 'Secondary Menu', 'myfirsttheme' )
) );
```

Each of the menus you define can be called later using `<a href="#reference/functions/wp_nav_menu">wp_nav_menu()</a>` and using the name assigned (i.e. primary) as the `theme_location` parameter.

In block themes, you use the [navigation block](https://wordpress.org/support/article/navigation-block/) instead.

#### Load Text Domain

Themes can be translated into multiple languages by making the strings in your theme available for translation. To do so, you must use `<a href="#reference/functions/load_theme_textdomain">load_theme_textdomain()</a>`. For more information on making your theme available for translation, read the [internationalization](#themes/functionality/internationalization "Internationalization & Text Domains") section.

```php
load_theme_textdomain( 'myfirsttheme', get_template_directory() . '/languages' );
```

#### Post Thumbnails

[Post thumbnails and featured images](#themes/functionality/featured-images-post-thumbnails "Featured Images & Post Thumbnails") allow your users to choose an image to represent their post. Your theme can decide how to display them, depending on its design. For example, you may choose to display a post thumbnail with each post in an archive view. Or, you may want to use a large featured image on your homepage. This feature is automatically enabled for block themes, and does not need to be included during theme setup.

```php
add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' );
```

#### Post Formats

[Post formats](#themes/functionality/post-formats "Post Formats") allow users to format their posts in different ways. This is useful for allowing bloggers to choose different formats and templates based on the content of the post. `add_theme_support()` is also used for Post Formats. This is **recommended**.

```php
add_theme_support( 'post-formats',  array( 'aside', 'gallery', 'quote', 'image', 'video' ) );
```

[Learn more about post formats.](#themes/functionality/post-formats)

#### Theme support in block themes

In block themes, the following theme supports are enabled automatically:

```php
add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' );
add_theme_support( 'responsive-embeds' );
add_theme_support( 'editor-styles' );
add_theme_support( 'html5', array( 'style','script' ) );
add_theme_support( 'automatic-feed-links' ); 
```

#### Initial Setup Example

Including all of the above features will give you a `functions.php` file like the one below. Code comments have been added for future clarity.

As shown at the bottom of this example, you must add the required `<a href="#reference/functions/add_action">add_action()</a>` statement to ensure the `myfirsttheme_setup` function is loaded.

```php
if ( ! function_exists( 'myfirsttheme_setup' ) ) :
	/**
	 * Sets up theme defaults and registers support for various
	 * WordPress features.
	 *
	 * Note that this function is hooked into the after_setup_theme
	 * hook, which runs before the init hook. The init hook is too late
	 * for some features, such as indicating support post thumbnails.
	 */
	function myfirsttheme_setup() {

    /**
	 * Make theme available for translation.
	 * Translations can be placed in the /languages/ directory.
	 */
		load_theme_textdomain( 'myfirsttheme', get_template_directory() . '/languages' );

		/**
		 * Add default posts and comments RSS feed links to <head>.
		 */
		add_theme_support( 'automatic-feed-links' );

		/**
		 * Enable support for post thumbnails and featured images.
		 */
		add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' );

		/**
		 * Add support for two custom navigation menus.
		 */
		register_nav_menus( array(
			'primary'   => __( 'Primary Menu', 'myfirsttheme' ),
			'secondary' => __( 'Secondary Menu', 'myfirsttheme' ),
		) );

		/**
		 * Enable support for the following post formats:
		 * aside, gallery, quote, image, and video
		 */
		add_theme_support( 'post-formats', array( 'aside', 'gallery', 'quote', 'image', 'video' ) );
	}
endif; // myfirsttheme_setup
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'myfirsttheme_setup' );

```

### Content Width

In classic themes, a content width is added to your `functions.php` file to ensure that no content or assets break the container of the site. The content width sets the maximum allowed width for any content added to your site, including uploaded images. In the example below, the content area has a maximum width of 800 pixels. No content will be larger than that.

```php
if ( ! isset ( $content_width) ) {
    $content_width = 800;
}
```

Themes that include a theme.json configuration file does not need to include the variable in functions.php. Instead, the content width is added to the layout setting in theme.json. You can [learn more about using theme.json in the advanced section](#themes/advanced-topics/theme-json).

### Other Features

There are other common features you can include in `functions.php`. Listed below are some of the most common features. Click through and learn more about each of these features.

- [Custom Headers](#themes/functionality/custom-headers) **-Classic themes**
- [Sidebars](#themes/functionality/sidebars) (widget areas) **-Classic themes**
- Custom Background **-Classic themes**
- Title tag **-Classic themes**
- Add Editor Styles
- HTML5 **-Classic themes**

## Your *functions.php* File

If you choose to include all the functions listed above, this is what your *functions.php* might look like. It has been commented with references to above.

```php
/**
 * MyFirstTheme's functions and definitions
 *
 * @package MyFirstTheme
 * @since MyFirstTheme 1.0
 */

/**
 * First, let's set the maximum content width based on the theme's
 * design and stylesheet.
 * This will limit the width of all uploaded images and embeds.
 */
if ( ! isset( $content_width ) ) {
	$content_width = 800; /* pixels */
}

if ( ! function_exists( 'myfirsttheme_setup' ) ) :

	/**
	 * Sets up theme defaults and registers support for various
	 * WordPress features.
	 *
	 * Note that this function is hooked into the after_setup_theme
	 * hook, which runs before the init hook. The init hook is too late
	 * for some features, such as indicating support post thumbnails.
	 */
	function myfirsttheme_setup() {

		/**
		 * Make theme available for translation.
		 * Translations can be placed in the /languages/ directory.
		 */
		load_theme_textdomain( 'myfirsttheme', get_template_directory() . '/languages' );

		/**
		 * Add default posts and comments RSS feed links to <head>.
		 */
		add_theme_support( 'automatic-feed-links' );

		/**
		 * Enable support for post thumbnails and featured images.
		 */
		add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' );

		/**
		 * Add support for two custom navigation menus.
		 */
		register_nav_menus( array(
			'primary'   => __( 'Primary Menu', 'myfirsttheme' ),
			'secondary' => __( 'Secondary Menu', 'myfirsttheme' ),
		) );

		/**
		 * Enable support for the following post formats:
		 * aside, gallery, quote, image, and video
		 */
		add_theme_support( 'post-formats', array( 'aside', 'gallery', 'quote', 'image', 'video' ) );
	}
endif; // myfirsttheme_setup
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'myfirsttheme_setup' );

```

# Linking Theme Files &amp; Directories <a name="themes/basics/linking-theme-files-directories" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/linking-theme-files-directories/

## Linking to Core Theme Files

As you’ve learned, WordPress themes are built from a number of different template files. At the very least this will usually include a `sidebar.php`, `header.php` and `footer.php`. These are called using [Template Tags](#themes/basics/template-tags "Template Tags"), for example: - [get\_header()](#reference/functions/get_header) ;
- [get\_footer()](#reference/functions/get_footer) ;
- [get\_sidebar()](#reference/functions/get_sidebar) ;

You can create custom versions of these files can be called as well by naming the file `sidebar-{your_custom_template}.php`, `header-{your_custom_template}.php` and `footer-{your_custom_template}.php`. You can then use Template Tags with the custom template name as the only parameter, like this: ```php
get_header( 'your_custom_template' );

get_footer( 'your_custom_template' );

get_sidebar( 'your_custom_template' );
```

WordPress creates pages by assembling various files. Aside from the standard files for the header, footer and sidebar, you can create custom template files and call them at any location in the page using [get\_template\_part()](#reference/functions/get_template_part) . To create a custom template file in your theme give the file an appropriate name and use the same custom template system as with the header, sidebar and footer files: ```php
slug-template.php
```

For example, if you would like to create a custom template to handle your post content you could create a template file called `content.php` and then add a specific content layout for product content by extending the file name to `content-product.php`. You would then load this template file in your theme like this: ```php
get_template_part( 'content', 'product' );
```

If you want to add more organization to your templates, you can place them in their own directories within your theme directory. For example, suppose you add a couple more *content* templates for *profiles* and *locations*, and group them in their own directory called `content-templates`. The theme hierarchy for your theme called `my-theme` might look like the following. `style.css` and `page.php` are included for context. - themes
- my-theme
- content-templates
- content-location.php
- content-product.php
- content-profile.php
- style.css

To include your content templates, prepend the directory names to the `slug` argument like this: ```php
get_template_part( 'content-templates/content', 'location' );

get_template_part( 'content-templates/content', 'product' );

get_template_part( 'content-templates/content', 'profile' );
```

## Linking to Theme Directories

To link to the theme’s directory, you can use the following function: - [get\_theme\_file\_uri()](#reference/functions/get_theme_file_uri) ;

If you are not using a child theme, this function will return the full URI to your theme’s main folder. You can use this to reference sub-folders and files in your theme like this: ```php
echo get_theme_file_uri( 'images/logo.png' );
```

If you are using a child theme then this function will return the URI of the file in your child theme if it exists. If the file cannot be found in your child theme, the function will return the URI of the file in the parent theme. This is particularly important to keep in mind when distributing a theme or in any other case where a child theme may or may not be active. To access the path to a file in your theme’s directories, you can use the following function: - [get\_theme\_file\_path()](#reference/functions/get_theme_file_path) ;

Like [get\_theme\_file\_uri()](#reference/functions/get_theme_file_uri) , this will access the path of the file in the child theme if it exists. If the file cannot be found in the child theme, the function will access the path to the file in the parent theme. In a child theme, you can link to a file URI or path in the parent theme’s directories using the following functions: - [get\_parent\_theme\_file\_uri()](#reference/functions/get_parent_theme_file_uri) ;
- [get\_parent\_theme\_file\_path()](#reference/functions/get_parent_theme_file_path) ;

As with `get_theme_file_uri(),` you can reference sub-folders and files like this: ```php
echo get_parent_theme_file_uri( 'images/logo.png' );

//or

echo get_parent_theme_file_path( 'images/logo.png' );
```

Take care when referencing files that may not be present, as these functions will return the URI or file path whether the file exists or not. If the file is missing, these functions will return a broken link. 

 The functions [get\_theme\_file\_uri()](#reference/functions/get_theme_file_uri) , [get\_theme\_file\_path()](#reference/functions/get_theme_file_path) , [get\_parent\_theme\_file\_uri()](#reference/functions/get_parent_theme_file_uri) , [get\_parent\_theme\_file\_path()](#reference/functions/get_parent_theme_file_path) were introduced in WordPress 4.7. For previous WordPress versions, use [get\_template\_directory\_uri()](#reference/functions/get_template_directory_uri) , [get\_template\_directory()](#reference/functions/get_template_directory) , [get\_stylesheet\_directory\_uri()](#reference/functions/get_stylesheet_directory_uri) , [get\_stylesheet\_directory()](#reference/functions/get_stylesheet_directory) . Take note that the newer 4.7 functions run the older functions anyway as part of the checking process so it makes sense to use the newer functions when possible.

## Dynamic Linking in Templates

Regardless of your permalink settings, you can link to a page or post dynamically by referring to its unique numerical ID (seen in several pages in the admin interface) with ```php
<a href="<?php echo get_permalink($ID); ?>">This is a link</a>
```

 This is a convenient way to create page menus as you can later change page slugs without breaking links, as IDs will stay the same. However, this might increase database queries.

# Including CSS &amp; JavaScript (Archived) <a name="themes/basics/including-css-javascript" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/including-css-javascript/

This is an old page that has been archived in favor of the newer [Including Assets documentation](#themes/core-concepts/including-assets) in the Core Concepts chapter. This page will eventually be removed and redirect to the newer doc.

When you’re creating your theme, you may want to create additional stylesheets or JavaScript files. However, remember that a WordPress website will not just have your theme active, it will also be using many different plugins. So that everything works harmoniously, it’s important that theme and plugins load scripts and stylesheets using the standard WordPress method. This will ensure the site remains efficient and that there are no incompatibility issues.

Adding scripts and styles to WordPress is a fairly simple process. Essentially, you will create a function that will enqueue all of your scripts and styles. When enqueuing a script or stylesheet, WordPress creates a handle and path to find your file and any dependencies it may have (like jQuery) and then you will use a hook that will insert your scripts and stylesheets.

## Enqueuing Scripts and Styles

The proper way to add scripts and styles to your theme is to enqueue them in the `functions.php` files. The `style.css` file is required in all themes, but it may be necessary to add other files to extend the functionality of your theme.

Tip: WordPress includes a number of JavaScript files as part of the software package, including commonly used libraries such as jQuery. Before adding your own JavaScript, [check to see if you can make use of an included library](#themes/basics/including-css-javascript).

The basics are:

1. Enqueue the script or style using `wp_enqueue_script()`, `wp_enqueue_style()`, or `wp_enqueue_block_style`.

### Stylesheets

Your CSS stylesheets are used to customize the presentation of your theme. A stylesheet is also the file where information about your theme is stored. For this reason, the `style.css` file is **required in every theme.**

Rather then loading the stylesheet in your `header.php` file, you should load it in using `wp_enqueue_style`. In order to load your main stylesheet, you can enqueue it in `functions.php`

To enqueue `style.css`:

```php
wp_enqueue_style( 'style', get_stylesheet_uri() );
```

This will look for a stylesheet named “style” and load it.

The basic function for enqueuing a style is:

```php
wp_enqueue_style( $handle, $src, $deps, $ver, $media );
```

You can include these parameters:

- **$handle** is simply the name of the stylesheet.
- **$src** is where it is located. The rest of the parameters are optional.
- **$deps** refers to whether or not this stylesheet is dependent on another stylesheet. If this is set, this stylesheet will not be loaded unless its dependent stylesheet is loaded first.
- **$ver** sets the version number.
- **$media** can specify which type of media to load this stylesheet in, such as ‘all’, ‘screen’, ‘print’ or ‘handheld.’

So if you wanted to load a stylesheet named “slider.css” in a folder named “CSS” in you theme’s root directory, you would use:

```php
wp_enqueue_style( 'slider', get_template_directory_uri() . '/css/slider.css', false, '1.1', 'all');
```

## Including CSS for block styles

In addition to `wp_enqueue_style()`, you can use `wp_enqueue_block_style()` to enqueue styles for blocks. [wp\_enqueue\_block\_style()](#reference/functions/wp_enqueue_block_style) requires WordPress version 5.9 or later.

A key part of creating block themes is performance. With, `wp_enqueue_block_style()`, the theme only loads the CSS for the selected block when the block is used on the page.

The additional style is loaded in the editor and the front, after the block style provided by WordPress and the Gutenberg plugin. You can use this method to add block styles that you can not add via `theme.json`. For example, media queries.

This code example changes the size and text color of the date in the latest comments block. Because this is a `time` HTML element that is nested inside other HTML elements, can not be styled using `theme.json`.

First, create a new CSS file with the name of the block: `latest-comments.css`.  
Where you place the file depends on how you organize your theme files. In the example, the file is placed inside the folders `assets/CSS/blocks`.

The CSS class for the time element is `wp-block-latest-comments__comment-date`. The prefix and the block name are followed by the partial, separated by two underscores.

You can read more about the naming convention for the block editor in the [coding guidelines](#block-editor/contributors/code/coding-guidelines).

The text color and font size are added with CSS custom properties that are generated from `theme.json`:

```css
.wp-block-latest-comments__comment-date {
	color: var(--wp--preset--color--primary);
	font-size: var(--wp--preset--font-size--small);
}
```

Next, enqueue the block style inside the themes setup function.

The block name is placed inside an array to load more than one block style.  
A `foreach` loop walks through each block in the array and creates a handle, src (source), and path argument.  
`wp_enqueue_block_style()` then enqueues the file using the block name and argument:  
`wp_enqueue_block_style( "prefix/blockname", $args );`

In the code example, the prefix is “core” since the style is for a core block. When you style blocks from plugins, you need to adjust the prefix.

```php
function myfirsttheme_setup() {
	/*
	 * Load additional block styles.
	 */
	$styled_blocks = ['latest-comments'];
	foreach ( $styled_blocks as $block_name ) {
		$args = array(
			'handle' => "myfirsttheme-$block_name",
			'src'    => get_theme_file_uri( "assets/css/blocks/$block_name.css" ),
			$args['path'] = get_theme_file_path( "assets/css/blocks/$block_name.css" ),
		);
		wp_enqueue_block_style( "core/$block_name", $args );
	}
}
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'myfirsttheme_setup' );

```

### Scripts

Any additional JavaScript files required by a theme should be loaded using `wp_enqueue_script`. This ensures proper loading and caching, and allows the use conditional tags to target specific pages. These are **optional**.

`wp_enqueue_script` uses a similar syntax to `wp_enqueue_style`.

Enqueue your script:

```php
wp_enqueue_script( $handle, $src, $deps, $ver, $args );
```

- **$handle** is the name for the script.
- **$src** defines where the script is located.
- **$deps** is an array that can handle any script that your new script depends on, such as jQuery.
- **$ver** lets you list a version number.
- **$args** an array of arguments that define footer printing (via an `in_footer` key) and script loading strategies (via a `strategy` key) such as `defer` or `async`. This replaces/overloads the `$in_footer` parameter as of WordPress version 6.3.

Your enqueue function may look like this:

```php
wp_enqueue_script( 'script', get_template_directory_uri() . '/js/script.js', array( 'jquery' ), 1.1, true);
```

### Delayed Script Loading

WordPress provides support for specifying a script loading strategy via the `wp_register_script()` and `wp_enqueue_script()` functions, by way of the `strategy` key within the new `$args` array parameter introduced in WordPress 6.3.

Supported strategies are as follows:

- **defer**
    - Added by specifying an array key value pair of `'strategy' => 'defer'` to the $args parameter.
    - Scripts marked for deferred execution — via the `defer` script attribute — are only executed once the DOM tree has fully loaded (but before the `DOMContentLoaded` and window load events). Deferred scripts are executed in the same order they were printed/added in the DOM, unlike asynchronous scripts.
- **async**
    - Added by specifying an array key value pair of `'strategy' => 'async'` to the `$args` parameter.
    - Scripts marked for asynchronous execution — via the `async` script attribute — are executed as soon as they are loaded by the browser. Asynchronous scripts do not have a guaranteed execution order, as script B (although added to the DOM after script A) may execute first given that it may complete loading prior to script A. Such scripts may execute either before the DOM has been fully constructed or after the `DOMContentLoaded` event.

Following is an example of specifying a loading strategy during script registration:

```php
wp_register_script( 
    'foo', 
    '/path/to/foo.js', 
    array(), 
    '1.0.0', 
    array( 
        'strategy'  => 'defer',
    )
);
```

The same approach applies when using `wp_enqueue_script()`.

When specifying a delayed script loading strategy, consideration of the script’s dependency tree (its dependencies and/or dependents) is taken into account when deciding on an “eligible strategy” so as not to result in application of a strategy that is valid for one script but detrimental to others in the tree by causing an unintended out of order of execution. As a result of such logic, the intended loading strategy that you pass via the `$args` parameter may not be the final (chosen) strategy, but it will never be detrimental to (or stricter than) the intended strategy.

### The Comment Reply Script

WordPress comments have quite a bit of functionality in them right out of the box, including threaded comments and enhanced comment forms. In order for comments to work properly, they require some JavaScript. However, since there are certain options that need to be defined within this JavaScript, the comment-reply script should be added to every classic theme that uses comments.

**In block themes, the script is included when you place a comment block. You do not need to add it manually.**

The proper way to include comment reply in classic themes is to use conditional tags to check if certain conditions exist, so that the script isn’t being loaded unnecessarily. For instance, you can only load scripts on single post pages using `<a data-id="#reference/functions/is_singular" data-type="URL" href="#reference/functions/is_singular">is_singular</a>`, and check to make sure that “Enable threaded comments” is selected by the user. So you can set up a function like:

```php
if ( is_singular() && comments_open() && get_option( 'thread_comments' ) ) {
	wp_enqueue_script( 'comment-reply' );
}
```

If comments are enabled by the user, and we are on a post page, then the comment reply script will be loaded. Otherwise, it will not.

### Combining Enqueue Functions

It is best to combine all enqueued scripts and styles into a single function, and then call them using the `wp_enqueue_scripts` action. This function and action should be located somewhere below the initial setup (performed above):

```php
function add_theme_scripts() {
	wp_enqueue_style( 'style', get_stylesheet_uri() );

	wp_enqueue_style( 'slider', get_template_directory_uri() . '/css/slider.css', array(), '1.1', 'all' );

	wp_enqueue_script( 'script', get_template_directory_uri() . '/js/script.js', array( 'jquery' ), 1.1, true );

	if ( is_singular() && comments_open() && get_option( 'thread_comments' ) ) {
		wp_enqueue_script( 'comment-reply' );
	}
}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'add_theme_scripts' );
```

## Default Scripts Included and Registered by WordPress

By default, WordPress includes many popular scripts commonly used by web developers, as well as the scripts used by WordPress itself. Some of them are listed on this reference page:

# Conditional Tags <a name="themes/basics/conditional-tags" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/conditional-tags/

Conditional Tags can be used in your Template Files in classic themes to alter the display of content depending on the conditions that the current page matches. They tell WordPress what code to display under specific conditions. Conditional Tags usually work with PHP [if](http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.if.php "PHP if conditional") /[else](http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.else.php "PHP else conditional") Conditional Statements.

The code begins by checking to see **if** a statement is true or false. If the statement is found to be true, the first set of code is executed. If it’s false, the first set of code is skipped, and the second set of code (after the **else**) is executed instead.

For example, you could ask if a user is logged in, and then provide a different greeting depending on the result.

```php
if ( is_user_logged_in() ) :
	echo 'Welcome, registered user!';
else :
	echo 'Welcome, visitor!';
endif;
```

Note the close relation these tags have to [WordPress Template Hierarchy](#themes/basics/template-hierarchy).

## Where to Use Conditional Tags

For a Conditional Tag to modify your data, the information must already have been retrieved from your database, i.e. the query must have already run. If you use a Conditional Tag before there is data, there’ll be nothing to ask the if/else statement about.

It’s important to note that WordPress loads `functions.php` before the query is run, so if you simply include a Conditional Tag in that file, it won’t work.

Two ways to implement Conditional Tags:

- place it in a [Template File](#themes/basics/template-files)
- create a function out of it in `functions.php` that hooks into an action/filter that triggers at a later point

## The Conditions For

Listed below are the conditions under which each of the following **conditional statements proves to be true**. Tags which can accept parameters are noted.

### The Main Page

[is\_home()](#reference/functions/is_home "Function_Reference/is_home")

This condition returns true when the main blog page is being displayed, usually in standard reverse chronological order. If your home page has been set to a Static Page instead, then this will only prove true on the page which you set as the “Posts page” in Settings &gt; Reading.

### The Front Page

[is\_front\_page()](#reference/functions/is_front_page "Function_Reference/is_front_page")

This condition returns true when the front page of the site is displayed, regardless of whether it is set to show posts or a static page.

Returns true when:

1. the main blog page is being displayed **and**
2. the Settings &gt; Reading -&gt; *Front page displays* option is set to *Your latest posts*

**OR**

1. when Settings &gt; Reading -&gt; *Front page displays* is set to *A static page* **and**
2. the Front Page value is the current Page being displayed.

### The Administration Panels

[is\_admin()](#reference/functions/is_admin "Function_Reference/is_admin")

This condition returns true when the Dashboard or the administration panels are being displayed.

### A Single Post Page

[is\_single()](#reference/functions/is_single "Function_Reference/is_single")

Returns true when any single Post (or attachment, or custom Post Type) is being displayed. This condition returns false if you are on a page.

```php
is_single( '17' );
```

[is\_single()](#reference/functions/is_single) can also check for certain posts by ID and other parameters. The above example proves true when Post 17 is being displayed as a single Post.

```php
is_single( 'Irish Stew' );
```

Parameters include Post titles, as well. In this case, it proves true when the Post with title “Irish Stew” is being displayed as a single Post.

```php
is_single( 'beef-stew' );
```

Proves true when the Post with Post Slug “beef-stew” is being displayed as a single Post.

```php
is_single( array( 17, 'beef-stew', 'Irish Stew' ) );
```

Returns true when the single post being displayed is either post ID 17, or the post\_name is “beef-stew”, or the post\_title is “Irish Stew”.

```php
is_single( array( 17, 19, 1, 11 ) );
```

Returns true when the single post being displayed is either post ID = 17, post ID = 19, post ID = 1 or post ID = 11.

```php
is_single( array( 'beef-stew', 'pea-soup', 'chilli' ) );
```

Returns true when the single post being displayed is either the post\_name “beef-stew”, post\_name “pea-soup” or post\_name “chilli”.

```php
is_single( array( 'Beef Stew', 'Pea Soup', 'Chilli' ) );
```

Returns true when the single post being displayed is either the post\_title is “Beef Stew”, post\_title is “Pea Soup” or post\_title is “Chilli”.

Note: This function does not distinguish between the post ID, post title, or post name. A post named “17” would be displayed if a post ID of 17 was requested. Presumably the same holds for a post with the slug “17”.

### A Single Post, Page, or Attachment

[is\_singular()](#reference/functions/is_singular)

Returns true for any is\_single, is\_page, and is\_attachment. It does allow testing for post types.

### A Sticky Post

[is\_sticky()](#reference/functions/is_sticky "Function_Reference/is_sticky")

Returns true if the “Stick this post to the front page” check box has been checked for the current post. In this example, no post ID argument is given, so the post ID for the Loop post is used.

```php
is_sticky( '17' );
```

Returns true when Post 17 is considered a sticky post.

### A Post Type

[get\_post\_type()](#reference/functions/get_post_type "Function_Reference/get_post_type")

You can test to see if the current post is of a certain type by including [get\_post\_type()](#reference/functions/get_post_type "Function Reference/get_post_type") in your conditional. It’s not really a conditional tag, but it returns the [registered post type](#reference/functions/register_post_type "Function Reference/Register Post Type") of the current post.

```php
if ( 'book' == get_post_type() ) { ... }
```

[post\_type\_exists() ](#reference/functions/post_type_exists "Function Reference/post_type_exists")

Returns true if a given post type is a registered post type. This does not test if a post is a certain post\_type. Note: This function replaces a function called is\_post\_type which existed briefly in 3.0 development.

### A Post Type is Hierarchical

[is\_post\_type\_hierarchical( $post\_type ) ](#reference/functions/is_post_type_hierarchical "Function-reference/is_post_type_hierarchical/")

Returns true if this $post\_type has been set with hierarchical support when registered.

```php
 is_post_type_hierarchical( 'book' );
```

Returns true if the book post type was registered as having support for hierarchical.

###  A Post Type Archive

[is\_post\_type\_archive()](#reference/functions/is_post_type_archive "Function_Reference/is_post_type_archive")

Returns true on any post type archive.

```php
is_post_type_archive( $post_type );
```

Returns true if on a post type archive page that matches $post\_type (can be a single post type or an array of post types).

To turn on post type archives, use ‘has\_archive’ =&gt; true, when [registering the post type](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/plugin-developer-handbook/9-custom-post-types-and-taxonomies/registering-custom-post-types/ "Function_Reference/register_post_type").

### Any Page Containing Posts

[comments\_open()](#reference/functions/comments_open "Function_Reference/comments_open")

When comments are allowed for the current Post being processed in the [WordPress Loop](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/part-one-theme-basics/the-loop/ "The Loop").

[pings\_open()](#reference/functions/pings_open "Function_Reference/pings_open")

When pings are allowed for the current Post being processed in the WordPress Loop.

### A “PAGE” Page

This section refers to WordPress Pages, not any generic webpage from your blog, or in other words to the built in *post\_type* ‘page’.

[is\_page()](#reference/functions/is_page "Function_Reference/is_page")

When any Page is being displayed.

```php
is_page( '42' );
```

When Page 42 (ID) is being displayed.

```php
is_page( 'About Me And Joe' );
```

When the Page with a *post\_title* of “About Me And Joe” is being displayed.

```php
is_page( 'about-me' );
```

When the Page with a *post\_name* (slug) of “about-me” is being displayed.

```php
is_page( array( 42, 'about-me', 'About Me And Joe' ) );
```

Returns true when the Pages displayed is either *post ID* = 42, or *post\_name* is “about-me”, or *post\_title* is “About Me And Joe”.

```php
is_page( array( 42, 54, 6 ) );
```

Returns true when the Pages displayed is either *post ID* = 42, or *post ID* = 54, or *post ID* = 6.

#### Testing for Paginated Pages

You can use this code to check whether you’re on the nth page in a Post or Page that has been divided into pages using the `\<!--nextpage--> `QuickTag. This can be useful, for example, if you wish to display meta-data only on the first page of a post divided into several pages.

##### Example 1

```php
<?php
$paged = $wp_query->get( 'page' );
if ( ! $paged || $paged < 2 ) :
	// This is not a paginated page (or it's simply the first page of a paginated page/post)
else :
	// This is a paginated page.
endif;
```

##### Example 2

```php
<?php
$paged = get_query_var( 'page' ) ? get_query_var( 'page' ) : false;
if ( $paged == false ) :
	// This is not a paginated page (or it's simply the first page of a paginated page/post)
else :
	// This is a paginated page.
endif;
```

#### Testing for Sub-Pages

There is no `is_subpage()` function, but you can test this with a little code:

```php
<?php
global $post; // if outside the loop

if ( is_page() && $post->post_parent ) :
	// This is a subpage
else :
	// This is not a subpage
endif;
```

**Snippet 1**

You can create your own is\_subpage() function using the code in Snippet 2. Add it to your functions.php file. It tests for a parent page in the same way as Snippet 1, but will return the ID of the page parent if there is one, or false if there isn’t.

**Snippet 2**

```php
<?php
function is_subpage() {
	// Load details about this page.
	global $post;

	// Test to see if the page has a parent
	if ( is_page() && $post->post_parent ) {
		// return the ID of the parent post
		return $post->post_parent;

	// there is no parent so ...
	} else {
		// ... the answer to the question is false
		return false;
	}
}
```

It is advisable to use a function like that in Snippet 2, rather than using the simple test like Snippet 1, if you plan to test for sub-pages frequently.

To test if the parent of a page is a specific page, for instance “About” (page id pid 2 by default), we can use the tests in Snippet 3. These tests check to see if we are looking at the page in question, as well as if we are looking at any child pages. This is useful for setting variables specific to different sections of a web site, so a different banner image, or a different heading.

**Snippet 3**

```php
<?php
// The page is "About", or the parent of the page is "About".
if ( is_page( 'about' ) || '2' == $post->post_parent ) {
	$bannerimg = 'about.jpg';
} elseif ( is_page( 'learning' ) || '56' == $post->post_parent ) {
	$bannerimg = 'teaching.jpg';
} elseif ( is_page( 'admissions' ) || '15' == $post->post_parent ) {
	$bannerimg = 'admissions.jpg';
// Just in case we are at an unclassified page, perhaps the home page
} else {
	$bannerimg = 'home.jpg';
}
```

Snippet 4 is a function that allows you to carry out the tests above more easily. This function will return true if we are looking at the page in question (so “About”) or one of its sub pages (so a page with a parent with ID “2”).

**Snippet 4**

Add Snippet 4 to your functions.php file, and call is\_tree( ‘id’ ) to see if the current page is the page, or is a sub page of the page. In Snippet 3, is\_tree( ‘2’ ) would replace “is\_page( ‘about’ ) || ‘2’ == $post-&gt;post\_parent” inside the first if tag.

Note that if you have more than one level of pages the parent page is the one directly above and not the one at the very top of the hierarchy.

### Is a Page Template

[is\_page\_template()](#reference/functions/is_page_template "Function reference/page template")

Is a Page Template being used?

```php
is_page_template( 'about.php' );
```

Is Page Template ‘about’ being used? Note that unlike other conditionals, if you want to specify a particular Page Template, you need to use the filename, such as about.php or my\_page\_template.php.

Note: if the file is in a subdirectory you must include this as well. Meaning that this should be the filepath in relation to your theme as well as the filename, for example ‘page-templates/about.php’.

When a Category archive page is being displayed.

```php
is_category( '9' );
```

When the archive page for Category 9 is being displayed.

```php
! in_category( array( 4, 5, 6 ) );
```

Returns true if the current post is NOT in either category 4, 5, or 6. Note the ! at the beginning.

Note: Be sure to check your spelling when testing. There’s a big difference between “is” or “in”.

## Working Examples

Here are working samples to demonstrate how to use these conditional tags.

### Single Post

This example shows how to use `<a data-id="#reference/functions/is_single" data-type="URL" href="#reference/functions/is_single">is_single()</a>` to display something specific only when viewing a single post page:

```php
<?php
if ( is_single() ) {
	echo 'This is just one of many fabulous entries in the ' . single_cat_title() . ' category!';
}
```

Another example of how to use Conditional Tags in the Loop. Choose to display content or excerpt in index.php when this is a display single post or the home page.

```php
<?php
if ( is_home() || is_single() ) {
	the_content();
} else {
	the_excerpt();
}
```

When you need display a code or element, in a place that is NOT the home page.

```php
<?php if ( ! is_home() ) {
	// Insert your markup ...
}
```

### Check for Multiple Conditionals

You can use [PHP operators](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.php) to evaluate multiple conditionals in a single if statement.

This is handy if you need to check whether combinations of conditionals evaluate to true or false.

```php
<?php

// Check to see if any of 2 conditionals are met.
if ( is_single() || is_page() ) {
	// If it's a single post or a single page, do something special.
}
if ( is_archive() && ! is_category( 'nachos' ) ) {
	// If it's an archive page for any category EXCEPT nachos, do something special.
}
```

```php
<?php

// Check to see if 3 conditionals are met.
if ( $query->is_main_query() && is_post_type_archive( 'products' ) && ! is_admin() ) {
	// If it's the main query on a custom post type archive for Products.
	// And if we're not in the WordPress admin, then do something special.
}

if ( is_post_type_archive( 'movies' ) || is_tax( 'genre' ) || is_tax( 'actor' ) ) {
	// If it's a custom post type archive for Movies.
	// Or it's a taxonomy archive for Genre.
	// Or it's a taxonomy archive for Actor, do something special.
}
```

### Date Based Differences

If someone browses our site by date, let’s distinguish posts in different years by using different colors:

```php
<?php if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>

	<h2 id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>">
		<a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>" rel="bookmark"><?php the_title(); ?></a>
	</h2>

	<small>
		<?php the_time( 'F jS, Y' ); ?> by <?php the_author(); ?>
	</small>

	<?php
	// Are we showing a date-based archive?
	if ( is_date() ) {
		if ( date( 'Y' ) != get_the_date( 'Y' ) ) {
			// this post was written in a previous year
			// so let's style the content using the "oldentry" class
			echo '<div class="oldentry">';
		} else {
			echo '<div class="entry">';
		}
	} else {
		echo '<div class="entry">';
	}
	the_content( 'Read the rest of this entry »' );
	echo '</div>';
	?>

<?php endwhile; endif; ?>
```

### Variable Sidebar Content

This example will display different content in your sidebar based on what page the reader is currently viewing.

```php
<div id="sidebar">

<?php
// Let's generate info appropriate to the page being displayed.
if ( is_home() ) {
	// We're on the home page, so let's show a list of all top-level categories.
	wp_list_categories( 'optionall=0&sort_column=name&list=1&children=0' );
} elseif ( is_category() ) {
	// We're looking at a single category view, so let's show _all_ the categories.
	wp_list_categories( 'optionall=1&sort_column=name&list=1&children=1&hierarchical=1' );
} elseif ( is_single() ) {
	// We're looking at a single page, so let's not show anything in the sidebar.
} elseif ( is_page() ) {
	// We're looking at a static page. Which one?
	if ( is_page( 'About' ) ) {
		// Our about page.
		echo 'This is my about page!';
	} elseif ( is_page( 'Colophon' ) ) {
		echo 'This is my colophon page, running on WordPress ' . bloginfo( 'version' ) . '';
	} else {
		// Catch-all for other pages.
		echo 'Vote for Pedro!';
	}
} else {
	// Catch-all for everything else (archives, searches, 404s, etc)
	echo 'Pedro offers you his protection.';
}
?>

</div><!-- #sidebar -->
```

### Helpful 404 Page

The [Creating an Error 404 Page](https://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_an_Error_404_Page) article as an example of using the PHP conditional function `isset()` in the [Writing Friendly Messages](https://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_an_Error_404_Page#Writing_Friendly_Messages) section.

### In the theme’s footer.php file

At times queries performed in other templates such as sidebar.php may corrupt certain conditional tags. For instance, in header.php a conditional tag works properly but doesn’t work in a theme’s footer.php. The trick is to put wp\_reset\_query before the conditional test in the footer. For example:

```php
<?php
wp_reset_query();
if ( is_page( '2' ) ) {
	echo 'This is page 2!';
}
```

# Custom Headers <a name="themes/functionality/custom-headers" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/custom-headers/

## Custom Header

[Custom headers](#themes/functionality/custom-headers) allow site owners to upload their own “title” image to their site, which can be placed at the top of certain pages. These can be customized and cropped by the user through a visual editor in the **Appearance &gt; Header** section of the admin panel. You may also place text beneath or on top of the header. To support fluid layouts and responsive design, these headers may also be flexible. Headers are placed into a theme using `get_custom_header()`, but they must first be added to your *functions.php* file using `add_theme_support()`. Custom headers are **optional.**

To set up a basic, flexible, custom header with text you would include the following code:

```php
<?php
function themename_custom_header_setup() {
	$args = array(
		'default-image'      => get_template_directory_uri() . 'img/default-image.jpg',
		'default-text-color' => '000',
		'width'              => 1000,
		'height'             => 250,
		'flex-width'         => true,
		'flex-height'        => true,
	);
	add_theme_support( 'custom-header', $args );
}
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'themename_custom_header_setup' );
```

 *The [`after_setup_theme`](#reference/hooks/after_setup_theme) hook is used so that custom headers are registered after the theme is loaded.*

### What are Custom Headers?

When you enable Custom Headers in your theme, users can change their header image using the WordPress theme Customizer. This gives users more control and flexibility over the look of their site.

## Add Custom Header Support to your Theme

To enable Custom Headers in your theme, add the following to your *`functions.php`* file:

```php
add_theme_support( 'custom-header' );
```

When enabling Custom Headers, you can configure several other options by passing along arguments to the `add_theme_support()` function.

You can pass specific configuration options to the `add_theme_support` function using an array:

```php
<?php
function themename_custom_header_setup() {
	$defaults = array(
		// Default Header Image to display.
		'default-image'          => get_template_directory_uri() . '/images/headers/default.jpg',
		// Display the header text along with the image.
		'header-text'            => false,
		// Header text color default.
		'default-text-color'     => '000',
		// Header image width (in pixels).
		'width'                  => 1000,
		// Header image height (in pixels).
		'height'                 => 198,
		// Header image random rotation default.
		'random-default'         => false,
		// Enable upload of image file in admin.
		'uploads'                => false,
		// Function to be called in theme head section.
		'wp-head-callback'       => 'wphead_cb',
		// Function to be called in preview page head section.
		'admin-head-callback'    => 'adminhead_cb',
		// Function to produce preview markup in the admin screen.
		'admin-preview-callback' => 'adminpreview_cb',
	);
}
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'themename_custom_header_setup' );
```

### Flexible Header Image

If flex-height or flex-width are not included in the array, height and width will be fixed sizes. If flex-height and flex-width are included, height and width will be used as suggested dimensions instead.

### Header text

By default, the user will have the option of whether or not to display header text over the image. There is no option to force the header text on the user, but if you want to remove the header text completely, you can set ‘header-text’ to ‘false’ in the arguments. This will remove the header text and the option to toggle it.

## Examples

### Set a custom header image

When the user first installs your theme, you can include a default header that will be selected before they choose their own header. This allows users to set up your theme more quickly and use your default image until they’re ready to upload their own.

Set a default header image 980px width and 60px height:

```php
<?php
$header_info = array(
	'width'         => 980,
	'height'        => 60,
	'default-image' => get_template_directory_uri() . '/images/sunset.jpg',
);
add_theme_support( 'custom-header', $header_info );

$header_images = array(
	'sunset' => array(
		'url'           => get_template_directory_uri() . '/images/sunset.jpg',
		'thumbnail_url' => get_template_directory_uri() . '/images/sunset_thumbnail.jpg',
		'description'   => 'Sunset',
	),
	'flower' => array(
		'url'           => get_template_directory_uri() . '/images/flower.jpg',
		'thumbnail_url' => get_template_directory_uri() . '/images/flower_thumbnail.jpg',
		'description'   => 'Flower',
	),
);
register_default_headers( $header_images );
```

![](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/custom_headers_example1.jpg?resize=393%2C712&ssl=1)Do not forget to call [register\_default\_headers()](#reference/functions/register_default_headers) to register a default image. In this example, `sunset.jpg` is the default image and `flower.jpg` is an alternative selection in Customizer.

From Administration Screen, Click **Appearance &gt; Header** to display Header Image menu in Customizer. Notice that width and height specified in [add\_theme\_support()](#reference/functions/add_theme_support) is displayed as recommended size, and `flower.jpg` is shown as selectable option.

### Use flexible headers

By default, the user will have to crop any images they upload to fit in the width and height you specify. However, you can let users upload images of any height and width by specifying ‘flex-width’ and ‘flex-height’ as true. This will let the user skip the cropping step when they upload a new photo.

Set flexible headers:

```php
<?php
$args = array(
	'flex-width'    => true,
	'width'         => 980,
	'flex-height'   => true,
	'height'        => 200,
	'default-image' => get_template_directory_uri() . '/images/header.jpg',
);
add_theme_support( 'custom-header', $args );
```

update your `header.php` file to:

```php
<img alt="" src="<?php header_image(); ?>" width="<?php echo absint( get_custom_header()->width ); ?>" height="<?php echo absint( get_custom_header()->height ); ?>">
```

### Displaying Custom Header

To display the custom header, function [get\_header\_image()](#reference/functions/get_header_image) retrieves the header image. [get\_custom\_header()](#reference/functions/get_custom_header) gets the custom header data.  
E.g. below shows how custom header images can be used to display the header in the theme. The below code goes into header.php file.

```php
<?php if ( get_header_image() ) : ?>
	<div id="site-header">
		<a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>" rel="home">
			<img src="<?php header_image(); ?>" width="<?php echo absint( get_custom_header()->width ); ?>" height="<?php echo absint( get_custom_header()->height ); ?>" alt="<?php echo esc_attr( get_bloginfo( 'name', 'display' ) ); ?>">
		</a>
	</div>
<?php endif; ?>
```

### Backwards Compatibility

Custom Headers are supported in WordPress 3.4 and above. If you’d like your theme to support WordPress installations that are older than 3.4, you can use the following code instead of `add_theme_support( ‘custom-header’);`

```php
<?php
global $wp_version;
if ( version_compare( $wp_version, '3.4', '>=' ) ) :
	add_theme_support( 'custom-header' );
else :
	add_custom_image_header( $wp_head_callback, $admin_head_callback );
endif;
```

## Function Reference

- [header\_image()](#reference/functions/header_image) Display header image URL.
- [get\_header\_image()](#reference/functions/get_header_image) Retrieve header image for custom header.
- [get\_custom\_header()](#reference/functions/get_custom_header) Get the header image data.
- [get\_random\_header\_image()](#reference/functions/get_random_header_image) Retrieve header image for custom header.
- [add\_theme\_support()](#reference/functions/add_theme_support) Registers theme support for a given feature.
- [register\_default\_headers()](#reference/functions/register_default_headers) Registers a selection of default headers to be displayed by the Customizer.

# Sidebars <a name="themes/functionality/sidebars" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/sidebars/

## What are Sidebars

A sidebar is any widgetized area of your theme. Widget areas are places in your theme where users can add their own widgets. You do not need to include a sidebar in your theme, but including a sidebar means users can add content to the widget areas through the Customizer or the Widgets Admin Panel.

Widgets can be employed for a variety of purposes, ranging from listing recent posts to conducting live chats.

The name “sidebars” comes from a time when widget areas were normally created in a long strip to the lefthand or righthand side of a blog. Today, sidebars have evolved beyond their original name. They can be included anywhere on your website. Think of a sidebar as **any area that contains widgets**.

## Registering a Sidebar

To use sidebars, you must register them in `functions.php`.

To begin, `register_sidebar()` has several parameters that should always be defined regardless of whether they are marked as optional. These include x, y, and z.

- **name** – your name for the sidebar. This is the name users will see in the Widgets panel.
- **id** – must be lowercase. You will call this in your theme using the `dynamic_sidebar` function.
- **description** – A description of the sidebar. This will also be shown in the admin Widgets panel.
- **class** – The CSS class name to assign to the widget’s HTML.
- **before\_widget** – HTML that is placed before every widget.
- **after\_widget** – HTML that is placed after every widget. Should be used to close tags from `before_widget`.
- **before\_title** – HTML that is placed before the title of each widget, such as a header tag.
- **after\_title** – HTML that is placed after every title. Should be used to close tags from `before_title`.

To register a sidebar we use `register_sidebar` and the `widgets_init` function.

```php
<?php
function themename_widgets_init() {
	register_sidebar( array(
		'name'          => __( 'Primary Sidebar', 'theme_name' ),
		'id'            => 'sidebar-1',
		'before_widget' => '<aside id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">',
		'after_widget'  => '</aside>',
		'before_title'  => '<h3 class="widget-title">',
		'after_title'   => '</h3>',
	) );
	register_sidebar( array(
		'name'          => __( 'Secondary Sidebar', 'theme_name' ),
		'id'            => 'sidebar-2',
		'before_widget' => '<ul><li id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">',
		'after_widget'  => '</li></ul>',
		'before_title'  => '<h3 class="widget-title">',
		'after_title'   => '</h3>',
	) );
}
```

Registering a sidebar tells WordPress that you’re creating a new widget area in **Appearance &gt; Widgets** that users can drag their widgets to. There are two functions for registering sidebars:

- [register\_sidebar()](#reference/functions/register_sidebar)
- [register\_sidebars()](#reference/functions/register_sidebars)

The first lets you register one sidebar and the second lets you register multiple sidebars.

 It is recommended that you register sidebars individually as it allows you to give unique and descriptive names to each sidebar. 

## Examples

For widget areas in header and footer, it makes sense to name them “Header Widget Area” and “Footer Widget Area”, rather than “Sidebar 1” and “Sidebar 2” (which is the default). This provides a useful description of where the sidebar is located.

The following code, added to `functions.php` registers a sidebar:

```php
<?php
add_action( 'widgets_init', 'my_register_sidebars' );
function my_register_sidebars() {
	/* Register the 'primary' sidebar. */
	register_sidebar(
		array(
			'id'            => 'primary',
			'name'          => __( 'Primary Sidebar' ),
			'description'   => __( 'A short description of the sidebar.' ),
			'before_widget' => '<div id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">',
			'after_widget'  => '</div>',
			'before_title'  => '<h3 class="widget-title">',
			'after_title'   => '</h3>',
		)
	);
	/* Repeat register_sidebar() code for additional sidebars. */
}
```

The code does the following:

- `register_sidebar` – tells WordPress that you’re registering a sidebar
- `'name' => __( 'Primary Widget Area', 'mytheme' ),` – is the widget area’s name that will appear in Appearance &gt; Widgets
- `'id' => 'sidebar-1'` – assigns an ID to the sidebar. WordPress uses ‘id’ to assign widgets to a specific sidebar.
- `before_widget`/`after_widget` – a wrapper element for widgets assigned to the sidebar. The “%1$s” and “%2$s” should always be left in `id` and `class` respectively so that plugins can make use of them. By default, WordPress sets these as list items but in the above example they have been altered to div.
- `before_title`/`after_title` – the wrapper elements for the widget’s title. By default, WordPress sets it to h2 but using h3 makes it more semantic.

Once your sidebar is registered, you can display it in your theme.

## Displaying Sidebars in your Theme

Now that your sidebars are registered, you will want to display them in your theme. To do this, there are two steps:

1. Create the `sidebar.php` template file and display the sidebar using the `dynamic_sidebar` function
2. Load in your theme using the `get_sidebar` function

### Create a Sidebar Template File

A sidebar template contains the code for your sidebar. WordPress recognizes the file `sidebar.php` and any template file with the name `sidebar-{name}.php`. This means that you can organize your files with each sidebar in its own template file.

### Example:

1\. Create `sidebar-primary.php`

2\. Add the following code:

```php
<div id="sidebar-primary" class="sidebar">
	<?php dynamic_sidebar( 'primary' ); ?>
</div>
```

Note that `dynamic_sidebar` takes a single parameter of `$index`, which can be either the sidebar’s name or id.

### Load your Sidebar

To load your sidebar in your theme, use the `get_sidebar` function. This should be inserted into the template file where you want the sidebar to display. To load the default `sidebar.php` use the following:

```php
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
```

To display the Primary sidebar, pass the `$name` parameter to the function:

```php
<?php get_sidebar( 'primary' ); ?>
```

## Customizing your Sidebar

There are lots of ways that you can customize your sidebars. Here are some examples:

### Display Default Sidebar Content

You may wish to display content if the user hasn’t added any widgets to the sidebar yet. To do this, you use the `is_sidebar_active()` function to check to see if the sidebar has any widgets. This accepts the `$index` parameter which should be the ID of the sidebar that you wish to check.

This code checks to see if the sidebar is active, if not it displays some content:

```php
<div id="sidebar-primary" class="sidebar">
	<?php if ( is_active_sidebar( 'primary' ) ) : ?>
		<?php dynamic_sidebar( 'primary' ); ?>
	<?php else : ?>
		<!-- Time to add some widgets! -->
	<?php endif; ?>
</div>
```

### Display Default Widgets

You may want your sidebar to be populated with some widgets by default. For example, display the Search, Archive, and Meta Widgets. To do this you would use:

```php
<div id="primary" class="sidebar">

	<?php do_action( 'before_sidebar' ); ?>

	<?php if ( ! dynamic_sidebar( 'sidebar-primary' ) ) : ?>

		<aside id="search" class="widget widget_search">
			<?php get_search_form(); ?>
		</aside><!-- #search -->

		<aside id="archives" class"widget">
			<h3 class="widget-title"><?php _e( 'Archives', 'shape' ); ?></h3>
			<ul>
				<?php wp_get_archives( array( 'type' => 'monthly' ) ); ?>
			</ul>
		</aside><!-- #archives -->

		<aside id="meta" class="widget">
			<h3 class="widget-title"><?php _e( 'Meta', 'shape' ); ?></h3>
			<ul>
				<?php wp_register(); ?>
				<li><?php wp_loginout(); ?></li>
				<?php wp_meta(); ?>
			</ul>
		</aside><!-- #meta -->

	<?php endif; ?>

</div><!-- #primary -->
```

# Widgets <a name="themes/functionality/widgets" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/widgets/

A widget adds content and features to a widget area (also called a [sidebar](#themes/functionality/sidebars "Sidebars")). Widget areas provide a way for users to customize their site. A widget area can appear on multiple pages or on only one page. Your theme might have just one widget area or many of them.

Some examples of ways you can use widget areas are:

- Lay out a homepage using widgets. This allows site owners to decide what should appear in each section of their homepage.
- Create a footer that users can customize with their own content.
- Add a customizable sidebar to a blog.

A widget is a PHP object that outputs some HTML. The same kind of widget can be used multiple times on the same page (e.g. the Text Widget). Widgets can save data in the database (in the options table).

When you create a new kind of widget, it will appear in the user’s Administration Screens at **Appearance &gt; Widgets**. The user can add the widget to a widget area and customize the widget settings from the WordPress admin.

## Built-in versus stand-alone widgets

A set of widgets is included with the default WordPress installation. In addition to these standard widgets, extra widgets can be included by themes or plugins. An advantage of widgets built into themes or plugins is to provide extra features and increase the number of widgets.

A disadvantage is that if a theme is changed or a plugin is deactivated, the plugin or theme widget’s functionality will be lost. However, the data and preferences from the widget will be saved to the options table and restored if the theme or plugin is reactivated.

If you include a widget with your theme, it can only be used if that theme is active. If the user decides to change their theme they will lose access to that widget. However, if the widget is included with a plugin, the user can change their theme without losing access to the widget functionality.

## Anatomy of a Widget

Visually, a widget comprises two areas:

1. Title Area
2. Widget Options

For example, here is the layout of the built-in text widget in the admin and on the front-end:

![Sample Editable Widget](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/docs/files/2013/06/widget_visual.png?ssl=1)A widget form in the admin area.![A widget as it appars to a site visitor.](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/docs/files/2013/06/Widget-front-end.png?ssl=1)A widget as it appears to a site visitor.HTML output for this widget looks like this:

```php
<div id="text-7" class="widget widget_text">

	<div class="widget-wrap">

		<h4 class="widgettitle">
			This is a text widget
		</h4><!-- .widgettitle -->

		<div class="textwidget">
			I can put HTML in here. <a href="http://google.com/">Search me!</a>
		</div><!-- .textwidget -->

	</div><!-- .widget-wrap -->

</div><!-- #text-7 -->
```

Each widget has its own way of outputting HTML that is relevant to the data being displayed. The wrapper tags for the widget are defined by the widget area in which it is being displayed.

The PHP code necessary to create a widget like the built-in text widget looks like this:

```php
<?php
class My_Widget extends WP_Widget {
	public function __construct() {
		parent::__construct(
			'my-text',  // Base ID
			'My Text'   // Name
		);
		add_action( 'widgets_init', function() {
			register_widget( 'My_Widget' );
		});
	}

	public $args = array(
		'before_title'  => '<h4 class="widgettitle">',
		'after_title'   => '</h4>',
		'before_widget' => '<div class="widget-wrap">',
		'after_widget'  => '</div></div>',
	);

	public function widget( $args, $instance ) {
		echo $args['before_widget'];
		if ( ! empty( $instance['title'] ) ) {
			echo $args['before_title'] . apply_filters( 'widget_title', $instance['title'] ) . $args['after_title'];
		}
		echo '<div class="textwidget">';
		echo esc_html__( $instance['text'], 'text_domain' );
		echo '</div>';
		echo $args['after_widget'];
	}

	public function form( $instance ) {
		$title = ! empty( $instance['title'] ) ? $instance['title'] : esc_html__( '', 'text_domain' );
		$text  = ! empty( $instance['text'] ) ? $instance['text'] : esc_html__( '', 'text_domain' );
		?>
		<p>
			<label for="<?php echo esc_attr( $this->get_field_id( 'title' ) ); ?>"><?php echo esc_html__( 'Title:', 'text_domain' ); ?></label>
			<input class="widefat" id="<?php echo esc_attr( $this->get_field_id( 'title' ) ); ?>" name="<?php echo esc_attr( $this->get_field_name( 'title' ) ); ?>" type="text" value="<?php echo esc_attr( $title ); ?>">
		</p>
		<p>
			<label for="<?php echo esc_attr( $this->get_field_id( 'Text' ) ); ?>"><?php echo esc_html__( 'Text:', 'text_domain' ); ?></label>
			<textarea class="widefat" id="<?php echo esc_attr( $this->get_field_id( 'text' ) ); ?>" name="<?php echo esc_attr( $this->get_field_name( 'text' ) ); ?>" type="text" cols="30" rows="10"><?php echo esc_attr( $text ); ?></textarea>
		</p>
		<?php
	}

	public function update( $new_instance, $old_instance ) {
		$instance          = array();
		$instance['title'] = ( ! empty( $new_instance['title'] ) ) ? strip_tags( $new_instance['title'] ) : '';
		$instance['text']  = ( ! empty( $new_instance['text'] ) ) ? $new_instance['text'] : '';
		return $instance;
	}
}
$my_widget = new My_Widget();
```

The code above will be explained in detail later in the article.

## Developing Widgets

To create and display a widget, you need to do the following:

1. Create your widget’s class by extending the standard [WP\_Widget](#reference/classes/wp_widget) class and some of its functions.
2. Register your widget so that it’s made available in the **Widgets** screen.
3. Make sure that your theme has at least one [widget area](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/theme-functionality/sidebars/ "Sidebars") in which to add the widgets.

### Your Widget Class

The [WP\_Widget](#reference/classes/wp_widget) class is located in [wp-includes/class-wp-widget.php](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.8/src/wp-includes/class-wp-widget.php)

```php
<?php
class My_Widget extends WP_Widget {
	public function __construct() {
		// actual widget processes
	}

	public function widget( $args, $instance ) {
		// outputs the content of the widget
	}

	public function form( $instance ) {
		// outputs the options form in the admin
	}

	public function update( $new_instance, $old_instance ) {
		// processes widget options to be saved
	}
}
```

The documentation for each of these functions can be found in the widget class code:

1. `<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.8/src/wp-includes/class-wp-widget.php#L175">construct</a>`: Set up your widget with a description, name, and display width in your admin.
2. `<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.8/src/wp-includes/class-wp-widget.php#L122">widget</a>`: Process the widget options and display the HTML on your page. The `$args` parameter provides the HTML you can use to display the widget title class and widget content class.
3. `<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.8/src/wp-includes/class-wp-widget.php#L154">form</a>`: Display the form that will be used to set the options for your widget. If your widget doesn’t have any options, you can skip this function (although it is still best practice to include it even if it’s empty).
4. `<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.8/src/wp-includes/class-wp-widget.php#L141">update</a>`: Save the widget options to the database. If your widget doesn’t have any options, you can skip this function (although it is still best practice to include it even if it’s empty).

### Registering a Widget

The [register\_widget()](#reference/functions/register_widget) function is used to register a widget.

Call this function using the widgets\_init hook:

```php
<?php
add_action( 'widgets_init', 'wpdocs_register_widgets' );
function wpdocs_register_widgets() {
	register_widget( 'My_Widget' );
}
```

The HTML that wraps the widget, as well as the class for the title and widget content, is specified at the time you register the widget area using [register\_sidebar()](#reference/functions/register_sidebar).

## Examples

### Example Text Widget

To build the text widget from the example at the beginning of this article. You will start by setting up a widget class that extends the [WP\_Widget](#reference/classes/wp_widget) class.

In the class constructor you will call the parent constructor and pass it your widget’s base ID and name. Also in the class constructor you will hook into the `<a href="#reference/hooks/widgets_init">widgets_init</a>` action to register your widget.

Next you will declare the arguments you will use when creating your widget. There are four arguments you must define, `before_title`, `after_title`, `before_widget`, and `after_widget`. These arguments will define the code that wraps your widgets title and the widget itself.

After defining your arguments, you will define the widgets function. This function takes two parameters, the `$args` array from before, and the `$instance` of the widget, and is the function that will process options from the form and display the HTML for the widget on the front-end of your site. In the example above the widget function simply outputs the widget title, while passing it through the `<a href="#reference/hooks/widget_title">widget_title</a>` filter. It then out puts a simple widget wrapper and the content of the widget’s text field. As outlined in the example, you can access the options from the widget that are stored in the `$instance`.

Next you will define the form function. This function takes one parameter, `$instance`, and outputs the form that the user uses to create the widget in the Widgets admin screen. In the example above, the function starts by defining the `$title` and `$text` variables and setting them to the previously entered values, if those values exist. Then it outputs a simple form with a text field for the title and a textarea for the text content.

Lastly you will define the update function. This function takes two parameters, `$new_instance` and `$old_instance`, and is responsible for updating your widgets with new options when they are submitted. Here you simply define `$instance` as an empty array. You then set the title and text keys to the `$new_instance` values if they exist. You then return `$instance`.

Finally, when all of the above is defined, you instantiate your new widget class and test your work.

### Sample Widget

```php
<?php
/**
 * Adds Foo_Widget widget.
 */
class Foo_Widget extends WP_Widget {
	/**
	 * Register widget with WordPress.
	 */
	public function __construct() {
		parent::__construct(
			'foo_widget', // Base ID
			'Foo_Widget', // Name
			array( 'description' => __( 'A Foo Widget', 'text_domain' ) ) // Args
		);
	}
	/**
	 * Front-end display of widget.
	 *
	 * @see WP_Widget::widget()
	 *
	 * @param array $args     Widget arguments.
	 * @param array $instance Saved values from database.
	 */
	public function widget( $args, $instance ) {
		extract( $args );
		$title = apply_filters( 'widget_title', $instance['title'] );
		echo $before_widget;
		if ( ! empty( $title ) ) {
			echo $before_title . $title . $after_title;
		}
		echo __( 'Hello, World!', 'text_domain' );
		echo $after_widget;
	}
	/**
	 * Back-end widget form.
	 *
	 * @see WP_Widget::form()
	 *
	 * @param array $instance Previously saved values from database.
	 */
	public function form( $instance ) {
		if ( isset( $instance['title'] ) ) {
			$title = $instance['title'];
		} else {
			$title = __( 'New title', 'text_domain' );
		}
		?>
		<p>
			<label for="<?php echo $this->get_field_name( 'title' ); ?>"><?php _e( 'Title:' ); ?></label>
			<input class="widefat" id="<?php echo $this->get_field_id( 'title' ); ?>" name="<?php echo $this->get_field_name( 'title' ); ?>" type="text" value="<?php echo esc_attr( $title ); ?>" />
		 </p>
		<?php
	}
	/**
	 * Sanitize widget form values as they are saved.
	 *
	 * @see WP_Widget::update()
	 *
	 * @param array $new_instance Values just sent to be saved.
	 * @param array $old_instance Previously saved values from database.
	 *
	 * @return array Updated safe values to be saved.
	 */
	public function update( $new_instance, $old_instance ) {
		$instance          = array();
		$instance['title'] = ( ! empty( $new_instance['title'] ) ) ? strip_tags( $new_instance['title'] ) : '';
		return $instance;
	}
} // class Foo_Widget
```

This sample widget can then be registered in the widgets\_init hook:

```php
<?php
// Register Foo_Widget widget
add_action( 'widgets_init', 'register_foo' );
function register_foo() {
	register_widget( 'Foo_Widget' );
}
```

### Example with a Namespace

If you use PHP 5.3 with namespaces you should call the constructor directly as in the following example:

```php
<?php
namespace a\b\c;

class My_Widget_Class extends \WP_Widget {
	public function __construct() {
		parent::__construct( 'baseID', 'name' );
	}
	// ... rest of the functions
}
```

and call the register widget with:

```php
<?php
// Register Foo_Widget widget
add_action( 'widgets_init', 'register_my_widget' );
function register_my_widget() {
	register_widget( 'a\b\c\My_Widget_Class' );
}
```

See [this answer at stack exchange](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5247302/php-namespace-5-3-and-wordpress-widget/5247436#5247436) for more detail.

## Special considerations

If you want to use a widget inside another template file, rather than in a sidebar, you can use `<a href="#reference/functions/the_widget">the_widget()</a>` to display it programmatically. The function accepts widget class names. You pass the widget class name to the function like this:

```php
<?php the_title(); ?>

<div class="content">
	<?php the_content(); ?>
</div><!-- .content -->

<div class="widget-section">
	<?php the_widget( 'My_Widget_Class' ); ?>
</div><!-- .widget-section -->
```

You may want to use this approach if you need to use a widget in a specific area on a page, such as displaying a list of events next to a form in a section on the front page of your site or displaying an email capture form on a mega-menu alongside your navigation.

# Navigation Menus <a name="themes/functionality/navigation-menus" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/navigation-menus/

Navigation Menus are customizable menus in your theme. They allow users to add Pages, Posts, Categories, and URLs to the menu. To create a navigation menu you’ll need to register it, and then display the menu in the appropriate location in your theme.

## Register Menus

In your theme’s functions.php, you need to register your menu(s). This sets the name that will appear at **Appearance -&gt; Menus**.

First of all, you will use [register\_nav\_menus()](#reference/functions/register_nav_menus) to register the menu.

In this example, two locations are added to the “Manage Locations” tab: “Header Menu” and “Extra Menu”.

```php
function register_my_menus() {
  register_nav_menus(
    array(
      'header-menu' => __( 'Header Menu' ),
      'extra-menu' => __( 'Extra Menu' )
     )
   );
 }
 add_action( 'init', 'register_my_menus' );
```

## Display Menus

Once you’ve registered your menus, you need to use [wp\_nav\_menu()](#reference/functions/wp_nav_menu) to tell your theme where to display them. For example, add the following code to your `header.php` file to display the header-menu that was registered above.

```php
wp_nav_menu( array( 'theme_location' => 'header-menu' ) );
```

 A full list of parameters can be found in the [wp\_nav\_menu()](#reference/functions/wp_nav_menu) page in the function reference

Repeat this process for any additional menus you want to display in your theme. Optionally, you can add a container class which allows you to style the menu with CSS.

```php
wp_nav_menu(
  array(
    'theme_location' => 'extra-menu',
    'container_class' => 'my_extra_menu_class'
  )
);
```

 A full list of CSS Classes can be found in the [wp\_nav\_menu()](#reference/functions/wp_nav_menu) page in the function reference. You can use these to style your menus. 

## Display Additional Contents

Below is a simplified version of the Twenty Seventeen footer social menu, which displays `span` elements before and after the menu item label text.

```php
wp_nav_menu(
  array(
    'menu' => 'primary',
    'link_before' => '<span class="screen-reader-text">',
    'link_after' => '</span>',
  )
);
```

The output will display as…

\[html\]  
&lt;div class="menu-social-container"&gt;  
 &lt;ul id="menu-social"&gt;  
 &lt;li id="menu-item-1"&gt;  
 &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;  
 &lt;/li&gt;  
 &lt;/ul&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;  
\[/html\]

 To display text between the `<li>` and `<a>` elements for each menu item, use `before` and `after` parameters.

## Define Callback

By default, WordPress displays the first non-empty menu when the specified menu or location is not found, or generates a Page menu when there is no custom menu selected. To prevent this, use the `theme_location` and `fallback_cb` parameters.

```php
wp_nav_menu(
  array(
    'menu' => 'primary',
    // do not fall back to first non-empty menu
    'theme_location' => '__no_such_location',
    // do not fall back to wp_page_menu()
    'fallback_cb' => false
  )
);
```

# Post Types <a name="themes/basics/post-types" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/post-types/

There are many different types of content in WordPress. These content types are normally described as Post Types, which may be a little confusing since it refers to all different types of content in WordPress. For example, a post is a specific Post Type, and so is a page.

Internally, all of the Post Types are stored in the same place — in the wp\_posts database table — but are differentiated by a database column called post\_type.

In addition to the default Post Types, you can also create Custom Post Types.

The [Template files](#themes/basics/template-files) page briefly mentioned that different Post Types are displayed by different Template files. As the whole purpose of a Template file is to display content a certain way, the Post Types purpose is to categorize what type of content you are dealing with. Generally speaking, certain Post Types are tied to certain template files.

## Default Post Types

There are several default Post Types readily available to users or internally used by the WordPress installation. The most common are:

- Post (Post Type: ‘post’)
- Page (Post Type: ‘page’)
- Attachment (Post Type: ‘attachment’)
- Revision (Post Type: ‘revision’)
- Navigation menu (Post Type: ‘nav\_menu\_item’)
- Block templates (Post Type: ‘wp\_template’)
- Template parts (Post Type: ‘wp\_template\_part’)

The Post Types above can be modified and removed by a plugin or theme, but it’s not recommended that you remove built-in functionality for a widely-distributed theme or plugin.

It’s out of the scope of this handbook to explain other post types in detail. However, it is important to note that you will interact with and build the functionality of [navigation menus](#themes/functionality/navigation-menus) and that will be detailed later in this handbook.

### Post

Posts are used in blogs. They are:

- displayed in reverse sequential order by time, with the newest post first
- have a date and time stamp
- may have the default [taxonomies of categories and tags](#themes/functionality/categories-tags-custom-taxonomies) applied
- are used for creating feeds

The template files that display the Post post type are:

- `singl`e and `single-post`
- `category` and all its iterations
- `tag` and all its iterations
- `taxonomy` and all its iterations
- `archive` and all its iterations
- `author` and all its iterations
- `date` and all its iterations
- `search`
- `home`
- `index`

[Read more about Post Template Files in classic themes](#themes/template-files-section/post-template-files).

### Page

Pages are a static Post Type, outside of the normal blog stream/feed. Their features are:

- non-time dependent and without a time stamp
- are not organized using the categories and/or tags taxonomies
- can be organized in a hierarchical structure — i.e. pages can be parents/children of other pages

The template files that display the Page post type are:

- `page` and all its iterations
- `front-page`
- `search`
- `index`

[Read more about Page Template Files in classic themes](#themes/template-files-section/page-template-files).

### Attachment

Attachments are commonly used to display images or media in content, and may also be used to link to relevant files. Their features are:

- contain information (such as name or description) about files uploaded through the media upload system
- for images, this includes metadata information stored in the wp\_postmeta table (including size, thumbnails, location, etc)

The template files that display the Attachment post type are:

- `MIME_type`
- `attachment`
- `single-attachment`
- `single`
- `index`

[Read more about Attachment Template Files in classic themes](#themes/template-files-section/attachment-template-files).

## Custom Post Types

Using Custom Post Types, you can **create your own post type**. It is not recommend that you place this functionality in your theme. This type of functionality should be placed/created in a plugin. This ensures the portability of your user’s content, and that if the theme is changed the content stored in the Custom Post Types won’t disappear.

You can learn more about [creating custom post types in the WordPress Plugin Developer Handbook](#plugins/post-types/registering-custom-post-types).

While you generally won’t develop Custom Post Types in your theme, you may want to code ways to display Custom Post Types that were created by a plugin. The following templates can display Custom post types:

- `single-{post-type}`
- `archive-{post-type}`
- `search`
- `index`

# Taxonomy Templates <a name="themes/template-files-section/taxonomy-templates" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/taxonomy-templates/

When a visitor clicks on a hyperlink to category, tag or custom taxonomy, WordPress displays a page of posts in reverse chronological order filtered by that taxonomy.

By default, this page is generated using the *index.php* template file. You can create optional template files to override and refine the *index.php* template files. This section explains how to use and create such templates.

## Taxonomy Template Hierarchy

WordPress display posts in the order determined by the [Template Hierarchy](#themes/basics/template-hierarchy "Template Hierarchy").

The *category.php*, *tag.php*, and *taxonomy.php* templates allow posts **filtered** by taxonomy to be treated differently from **unfiltered** posts or posts **filtered by a different taxonomy**. (Note: post refers to any post type – posts, pages, custom post types, etc.). These files let you target specific taxonomies or specific taxonomy terms. For example:

- *taxonomy-{taxonomy}-{term}.php*
- *taxonomy-{taxonomy}.php*
- *tag-{slug}.php*
- *tag-{id}.php*
- *category-{slug}.php*
- *category-{ID}.php*

So you could format all posts in an animal taxonomy named *news* on a page that looks different from posts filtered in other categories.

The *archive.php* template provides the most general form of control, providing a layout for all archives; that is, a page that displays a list of posts.

### Category

For categories, WordPress looks for the *category-{slug}.php* file. If it doesn’t exist, WordPress then looks for a file for the next hierarchical level, *category-{ID}.php*, and so on. If WordPress fails to find any specialized templates or an *archive.php* template file, it reverts to the default behavior, using *index.php*.

The category hierarchy is listed below:

1. *category-{slug}.php*: For example, if the category’s slug is named “news,” WordPress would look for a file named *category-news.php.*
2. *category-{ID}.php*: For example, if the category’s ID is “6”, WordPress would look for a file named *category-6.php.*
3. *category.php*
4. *archive.php*
5. *index.php*

### Tag

For tags, WordPress looks for the *tag-{slug}.php* file. If it doesn’t exist, WordPress then looks for a file for the next hierarchical level, *tag-{ID}.php*, and so on. If WordPress fails to find any specialized templates or an *archive.php* template file, it will revert to the default behavior, using *index.php*.

The tag hierarchy is listed below:

1. *tag-{slug}.php*: For example, if the tag’s slug is named “sometag,” WordPress would look for a file named *tag-sometag.php.*
2. *tag-{id}.php*: For example, if the tag’s ID were “6,” WordPress would look for a file named *tag-6.php*.
3. *tag.php*
4. *archive.php*
5. *index.php*

### Custom Taxonomy

A custom taxonomy hierarchy works similarly to the categories and tags hierarchies described above. WordPress looks for the *taxonomy-{taxonomy}-{term}.php* file. If it doesn’t exist, WordPress then looks for a file for the next hierarchical level, *taxonomy-{taxonomy}.php*, and so on. If WordPress fails to find any specialized templates or an *archive.php* template file, it will revert to the default behavior, using *index.php*.

The hierarchy for a custom taxonomy is listed below:

1. *taxonomy-{taxonomy}-{term}.php*: For example, if the taxonomy is named “sometax,” and the taxonomy’s term is “someterm,” WordPress would look for a file named *taxonomy-sometax-someterm.php*.
2. *taxonomy-{taxonomy}.php*: For example, if the taxonomy is named “sometax,” WordPress would look for a file named *taxonomy-sometax.php*
3. *taxonomy.php*
4. *archive.php*
5. *index.php*

## Creating Taxonomy Template Files

Now you’ve decided that you need to create custom designs for content based on taxonomies, where do you start?

Rather than starting from a blank file, it is good practice to **copy the next file in the hierarchy**, if it exists. If you’ve already created an *archive.php*, make a copy called *category.php* and modify that to suit your design needs. If you don’t have an *archive.php* file, use a copy of your theme’s *index.php* as a starting point.

Follow the same procedure if you are creating any taxonomy template file. Use a copy of your *archive.php*, *category.php*, *tag.php*, or *index.php* as a starting point.

## Examples

Now that you’ve selected the template file in your theme’s directory that you need to modify, let’s look at some examples.

### Adding Text to Category Pages

#### Static Text Above Posts

Suppose you want some static text displayed before the list of posts on your category page(s). “Static” is text that remains the same, no matter which posts are displayed below, and no matter which category is displayed.

Open your file and above [The Loop](#themes/basics/the-loop "The Loop") section of your Template file, insert the following code:

```markup
<p>This is some text that will display at the top of the Category page.</p>
```

This text will only display on an archive page displaying posts in that category.

#### Different Text on Some Category Pages

What if you want to display different text based on the category page that the visitor is using? You could add default text to the main *category.php* file, and create special *category-{slug}.php* files each with their own version of the text, but this would create lots of files in your theme. Instead, you can use [conditional tags](#themes/basics/conditional-tags "Conditional Tags").

Again, this code would be added before the loop:

```php
<?php if ( is_category( 'Category A' ) ) : ?>
	<p>This is the text to describe category A.</p>
<?php elseif ( is_category( 'Category B' ) ) : ?>
	<p>This is the text to describe category B.</p>
<?php else : ?>
	<p>This is some generic text to describe all other category pages, I could be left blank.</p>
<?php endif; ?>
```

This code does the following:

1. Checks to see if the visitor has requested Category A. If yes, it displays the first piece of text.
2. Checks for category B if the user didn’t request category A. If yes, it displays the second piece of text.
3. Displays the default text, if neither was requested.

#### Display Text only on First Page of Archive

If you have more posts than fits on one page of your archive, the category splits into multiple pages. Perhaps you want to display static text, if the user is on the first page of the results.

To do this, use a PHP if statement that looks at the value of the $paged WordPress variable.

Put the following above The Loop:

```php
<?php if ( $paged < 2 ) : ?>
	<p>Text for first page of Category archive.</p>
<?php endif; ?>
```

This code asks whether the page displayed is the first page of the archive. If it is, the text for the first page is displayed. Otherwise, the text for the subsequent pages is displayed.

### Modify How Posts are Displayed

#### Excerpts vs. Full Posts

You can choose whether to display full posts or just excerpts. By displaying excerpts, you shorten the length of your archive page.

Open your file and find the loop. Look for:

```php
the_content()
```

And replace it with:

```php
the_excerpt()
```

And if your theme is displaying excerpts but you want to display the full content, replace `the_excerpt` with `the_content`.

# Categories, Tags, &amp; Custom Taxonomies <a name="themes/basics/categories-tags-custom-taxonomies" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/categories-tags-custom-taxonomies/

Categories, tags, and taxonomies are all related and can be easily confused.

We’ll use the example of building a theme for a recipe website to help break down categories, tags, and taxonomies.

In our recipe website, the **categories** would be Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Appetizers, Soups, Salads, Sides, and Desserts. All recipes will fit within those categories, but users might want to search for something specific like chocolate desserts or ginger chicken dinners.

Chocolate, ginger, and chicken are all examples of **tags**. They are another level of specificity that provides meaning to the user.

Lastly, there are taxonomies. In reality, categories and tags are examples of default taxonomies which simply are a way to organize content. Taxonomies are the method of classifying content and data in WordPress. When you use a taxonomy you’re grouping similar things together. The taxonomy refers to the sum of those groups. As with Post Types, there are a number of default taxonomies, and you can also create your own.

Recipes are normally organized by category and tag, but there are some other helpful ways to break the recipes down to be more user friendly. For example, the recipe website might want an easy way to display recipes by cook time. A custom taxonomy of cook time with 0-30 min, 30-min to an hour, 1 to 2 hours, 2+ hours would be a great breakdown. Additionally, cook method such as grill, oven, stove, refrigerator, etc would be another example of a custom taxonomy that would be relevant for the site. There could also be a custom taxonomy for how spicy the recipe is and then a rating from 1-5 on spiciness.

## Default Taxonomies

The default taxonomies in WordPress are:

- categories: a hierarchical taxonomy that organizes content in the *post* Post Type
- tags: a non-hierarchical taxonomy that organizes content in the *post* Post Type
- post formats: a method for creating formats for your posts. You can learn more about these on the [Post Formats](#themes/functionality/post-formats "Post Formats") page.

### Terms

Terms are items within your taxonomy. So, for example, if you have the *Animal* taxonomy you would have the terms, dogs, cats, and sheep. Terms can be created via the WordPress admin, or you can use the [wp\_insert\_term()](#reference/functions/wp_insert_term "wp_insert_term") function.

## Database Schema

Taxonomies and terms are stored in the following database tables:

- wp\_terms – stores all of the terms
- wp\_term\_taxonomy – places the term in a taxonomy
- wp\_term\_relationships – relates the taxonomy to an object (for example, *category* to *post)*

[![taxonomy-schema](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/taxonomy-schema.png?resize=311%2C452&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/taxonomy-schema.png?ssl=1)## Templates

WordPress offers several different hierarchies of templates for categories, tags, or custom taxonomies. More details on their structure and usage may be found on the [Taxonomy Templates](#themes/functionality/taxonomy-templates "Taxonomy Templates") page.

## Custom Taxonomies

It is possible to create new taxonomies in WordPress. You may, for example, want to create an *author* taxonomy on a book review website, or an *actor* taxonomy on a film site. As with custom post type **it is recommended that you put this functionality in a plugin**. This ensures that when the user changes their website’s design, their content is preserved in the plugin.

You can read more about creating custom taxonomies in the [Plugin Developer Handbook.](#plugins/taxonomy/working-with-custom-taxonomies "Working with Custom Taxonomies")

# Pagination <a name="themes/functionality/pagination" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/pagination/

Pagination allows your user to *page* back and forth through multiple pages of content.

WordPress can use pagination when:

- Viewing lists of posts when more posts exist than can fit on one page, or
- Breaking up longer posts by manually by using the following tag: `<!--nextpage-->`

## Using Pagination to Navigate Post Lists

The most common use for pagination in WordPress sites is to break up long lists of posts into separate pages. Whether you’re viewing a category, archive, or default index page for a blog or site, WordPress only shows 10 posts per page by default. Users can change the number of posts that appear on each page on the Reading screen: **Admin &gt; Settings &gt; Reading**.

## Examples

### Loop with Pagination

This simplified example shows where you can add pagination functions for the main loop. Add the functions just before or after the loop.

```php
<?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?>

    <!-- Start the pagination functions before the loop. -->
    <div class="nav-previous alignleft"><?php next_posts_link( 'Older posts' ); ?></div>
    <div class="nav-next alignright"><?php previous_posts_link( 'Newer posts' ); ?></div>
    <!-- End the pagination functions before the loop. -->

	<!-- Start of the main loop. -->
	<?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();  ?>

	<!-- the rest of your theme's main loop -->

    <?php endwhile; ?>
    <!-- End of the main loop -->

    <!-- Start the pagination functions after the loop. -->
    <div class="nav-previous alignleft"><?php next_posts_link( 'Older posts' ); ?></div>
    <div class="nav-next alignright"><?php previous_posts_link( 'Newer posts' ); ?></div>
    <!-- End the pagination functions after the loop. -->

<?php else : ?>

	<?php _e( 'Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.' ); ?>

<?php endif; ?>

```

### Methods for displaying pagination links

When using any of these pagination functions outside the template file with the loop that is being paginated, you must call the global variable $wp_query.

```php
function your_themes_pagination() {
	global $wp_query;
	echo paginate_links();
}
```

WordPress has numerous functions for displaying links to other pages in your loop. Some of these functions are only used in very specific contexts. You would use a different function on a single post page then you would on a archive page. The following section covers archive template pagination functions. The section after that cover single post pagination.

#### Simple Pagination

**posts\_nav\_link**

One of the simplest methods is [posts\_nav\_link()](#reference/functions/posts_nav_link). Simply place the function in your template after your loop. This generates both links to the next page of posts and previous page of posts where applicable. This function is ideal for themes that have simple pagination requirements.

```php
posts_nav_link();
```

**next\_posts\_link &amp; prev\_posts\_link**

When building a theme, use [next\_posts\_link()](#reference/functions/next_posts_link) and [prev\_posts\_link()](#reference/functions/previous_posts_link). to have control over where the previous and next posts page link appears.

```php
next_posts_link();
previous_posts_link();
```

If you need to pass the pagination links to a PHP variable, you can use [get\_next\_posts\_link()](#reference/functions/get_next_posts_link) and [get\_previous\_posts\_link()](#reference/functions/get_previous_posts_link).

```php
$next_posts = get_next_posts_link();
$prev_posts = get_previous_posts_link();
```

#### Numerical Pagination

When you have many pages of content it is a better experience to display a list of page numbers so the user can click on any one of the page links rather then having to repeatedly click next or previous posts. WordPress provides several functions for automatically displaying a numerical pagination list.

**For WordPress 4.1+**

If you want more robust pagination options, you can use [the\_posts\_pagination()](#reference/functions/the_posts_pagination) for WordPress 4.1 and higher. This will output a set of page numbers with links to previous and next pages of posts.

```php
the_posts_pagination();
```

**For WordPress prior to 4.1**

If you want your pagination to support older versions of WordPress, you must use [paginate\_links()](#reference/functions/paginate_links).

```php
echo paginate_links();
```

#### Pagination Between Single Posts

All of the previous functions should be used on index and archive pages. When you are viewing a single blog post, you must use [prev\_post\_link](#reference/functions/previous_post_link) and [next\_post\_link](#reference/functions/next_post_link). Place the following functions below the loop on your single.php.

```php
previous_post_link();
next_post_link();
```

### Pagination within a post

WordPress gives you a tag that can be placed in post content to enable pagination for that post:  
`\<!--nextpage-->`  
If you use that tag in the content, you need to ensure that the [wp\_link\_pages](#reference/functions/wp_link_pages) function is placed in your single.php template within the loop.

```php
<?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?>

	<!-- Start of the main loop. -->
	<?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>

		<?php the_content(); ?>

		<?php wp_link_pages(); ?>

	<?php endwhile; ?>
	<!-- End of the main loop. -->

<?php endif; ?>

```

# Comment Template <a name="themes/template-files-section/partial-and-miscellaneous-template-files/comment-template" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/partial-and-miscellaneous-template-files/comment-template/

WordPress displays comments in your theme based on the settings and code in the `comments.php` file within your WordPress theme.

## Simple comments loop

```php
// Get only the approved comments
$args = array(
	'status' => 'approve',
);

// The comment Query
$comments_query = new WP_Comment_Query();
$comments       = $comments_query->query( $args );

// Comment Loop
if ( $comments ) {
	foreach ( $comments as $comment ) {
		echo '<p>' . $comment->comment_content . '</p>';
	}
} else {
	echo 'No comments found.';
}
```

The `comments.php` template contains all the logic needed to pull comments out of the database and display them in your theme.

Before we explore the template file you’ll want to know how to pull in the partial template file on the appropriate pages such as `single.php`. You’ll wrap the comment [template tag](#themes/basics/template-tags) in a conditional statement so comments.php is only pulled in if it makes sense to do.

```php
// If comments are open or we have at least one comment, load up the comment template.
if ( comments_open() || get_comments_number() ) :
	comments_template();
endif;
```

![functionality-comments-01](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/functionality-comments-01.png?resize=350%2C257&ssl=1)## Another comments.php Example

Here’s an example of the `comments.php` template included with the Twenty Thirteen theme:

```php
<?php
/**
 * The template for displaying Comments.
 *
 * The area of the page that contains comments and the comment form.
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage Twenty_Thirteen
 * @since Twenty Thirteen 1.0
 */

/*
 * If the current post is protected by a password and the visitor has not yet
 * entered the password we will return early without loading the comments.
 */
if ( post_password_required() ) {
	return;
}
?>

<div id="comments" class="comments-area">

	<?php if ( have_comments() ) : ?>
		<h2 class="comments-title">
			<?php
			printf(
				_nx(
					'One thought on "%2$s"',
					'%1$s thoughts on "%2$s"',
					get_comments_number(),
					'comments title',
					'twentythirteen'
				),
				number_format_i18n( get_comments_number() ),
				'<span>' . get_the_title() . '</span>'
			);
			?>

		<ol class="comment-list">
			<?php
			wp_list_comments( array(

				'short_ping'  => true,
				'avatar_size' => 74,
			) );
			?>
		</ol><!-- .comment-list -->

		<?php if ( get_comment_pages_count() > 1 && get_option( 'page_comments' ) ) : ?>
			<nav class="navigation comment-navigation" role="navigation">

				<h1 class="screen-reader-text section-heading"><?php _e( 'Comment navigation', 'twentythirteen' ); ?></h1>
				<div class="nav-previous"><?php previous_comments_link( __( '&larr; Older Comments', 'twentythirteen' ) ); ?></div>
				<div class="nav-next"><?php next_comments_link( __( 'Newer Comments &rarr;', 'twentythirteen' ) ); ?></div>

			<p class="no-comments"><?php _e( 'Comments are closed.', 'twentythirteen' ); ?></p>
		<?php endif; ?>

	<?php endif; // have_comments() ?>

	<?php comment_form(); ?>

</div><!-- #comments -->

```

## Breaking down the comments.php

The above `comments.php` can be broken down to the below parts for better understanding.

1. [Template Header](#template-header)
2. [Comments Title](#comments-title)
3. [Comment Listing](#comment-listing)
4. [Comment Pagination](#comment-pagination)
5. [Comments are closed message](#comments-are-closed-message).
6. [The End](#the-end)

### Template Header

This template begins by identifying the template.

```php
<?php
/**
 * The template for displaying Comments.
 *
 * The area of the page that contains comments and the comment form.
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage Twenty_Thirteen
 * @since Twenty Thirteen 1.0
 */
```

Next, there’s a test to see if the post is password protected and, if so, it stops processing the template.

```php
/*
 * If the current post is protected by a password and the visitor has not yet
 * entered the password we will return early without loading the comments.
 */
if ( post_password_required() )
 return;
?>
```

Finally, there’s a test to see if there are comments associated with this post.

```php
<div id="comments" class="comments-area">
	<?php if ( have_comments() ) : ?>
```

### Comments Title

Prints out the header that appears above the comments.

Uses the [\_nx()](#reference/functions/_nx) translation function so other developers can provide alternative language translations.

```php
<h2 class="comments-title">
	<?php
	printf(
		_nx(
			'One thought on "%2$s"',
			'%1$s thoughts on "%2$s"',
			get_comments_number(),
			'comments title',
			'twentythirteen'
		),
		number_format_i18n( get_comments_number() ),
		'<span>' . get_the_title() . '</span>'
	);
	?>
</h2>
```

### Comment Listing

The following snippet creates an ordered listing of comments using the [wp\_list\_comments()](#reference/functions/wp_list_comments) function.

```php
<ol class="comment-list">
	<?php
	wp_list_comments( array(
		'style'       => 'ol',
		'short_ping'  => true,
		'avatar_size' => 74,
	) );
	?>
</ol><!-- .comment-list -->
```

### Comment Pagination

Checks to see if there are enough comments to merit adding comment navigation and, if so, create comment navigation.

```php
<?php if ( get_comment_pages_count() > 1 && get_option( 'page_comments' ) ) : ?>

	<nav class="navigation comment-navigation" role="navigation">

		<h3 class="screen-reader-text section-heading"><?php _e( 'Comment navigation', 'twentythirteen' ); ?></h3>
		<div class="nav-previous"><?php previous_comments_link( __( '&larr; Older Comments', 'twentythirteen' ) ); ?></div>
		<div class="nav-next"><?php next_comments_link( __( 'Newer Comments &rarr;', 'twentythirteen' ) ); ?></div>

	</nav><!-- .comment-navigation -->

<?php endif; // Check for comment navigation ?>

```

### Comments are closed message.

If comments aren’t open, displays a line indicating that they’re closed.

```php
<?php if ( ! comments_open() && get_comments_number() ) : ?>
	<p class="no-comments"><?php _e( 'Comments are closed.', 'twentythirteen' ); ?></p>
<?php endif; ?>
```

### The End

This section ends the comments loop, includes the comment form, and closes the comment wrapper.

```php
	<?php endif; // have_comments() ?>

	<?php comment_form(); ?>

</div><!-- #comments -->
```

## Comments Pagination

If you have a lot of comments (which makes your page long), then there are a number of potential benefits to paginating your comments. Pagination helps improve page load speed, especially on mobile devices.  
Enabling comments pagination is done in two steps.

1. Enable paged comments within WordPress by going to *Settings* &gt; *Discussion* , and checking the box “*Break comments into pages*” . You can enter any number for the “*top level comments per page*”.
2. Open your `comments.php` template file and add the following line where you want the comment pagination to appear.

```php
<div class="pagination">
	<?php paginate_comments_links(); ?>
</div>
```

## Alternative Comment Template

On some occasions you may want display your comments differently within your theme. For this you would build an alternate file (ex. short-comments.php) and call it as follows:

```php
<?php comments_template( '/short-comments.php' );
```

The path to the file used for an alternative comments template should be relative to the current theme root directory, and include any subfolders. So if the custom comments template is in a folder inside the theme, it may look like this when called:

```php
<?php comments_template( '/custom-templates/alternative-comments.php' );
```

## Function Reference

- [wp\_list\_comments()](#reference/functions/wp_list_comments) : Displays all comments for a post or Page based on a variety of parameters including ones set in the administration area.
- [comment\_form()](#reference/functions/comment_form) : This tag outputs a complete commenting form for use within a template.
- [comments\_template()](#reference/functions/comments_template) : Load the comment template specified in first argument
- [paginate\_comments\_links()](#reference/functions/paginate_comments_links) : Create pagination links for the comments on the current post.
- [get\_comments()](#reference/functions/get_comments) : Retrieve the comments with possible use of arguments

# Media <a name="themes/functionality/media" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/media/

WordPress enables theme developers to customize the look, feel, and functionality of the platform’s core media capabilities.

## General

In WordPress you can upload, store, and display a variety of media such as image, video and audio files. Media can be uploaded via the **Media &gt; Add New** in the [Administration Screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Screens), or Add Media button on the Post/Page Editor.

If a media file is uploaded within the edit screen, it will be automatically attached to the current post being created or edited. If it is uploaded via the Media’s Add New Screen or the Media Library Screen, it will be unattached, but may become attached to a post when it is inserted into a post later on.

### Retrieving attachment ID or image ID

To retrieve the attachment ID, use `<a href="#reference/functions/get_posts">get_posts()</a>` or `<a href="#reference/functions/get_children">get_children()</a>` function. This example retrieves the all attachments of the current post and getting all metadata of attachment by specifying the ID.

```php
// Insert into the Loop
$args = array(
    'post_parent'    => get_the_ID(),
    'post_type'      => 'attachment',
);
$attachments = get_posts( $args );
if ( $attachments ) {
    foreach ( $attachments as $attachment ) {
        $meta_data = wp_get_attachment_metadata( $attachment->ID, false );
    }
}
```

If you want to retrieve images from the post ID only, specify post\_mime\_type as image.

```php
$args = array(
    'post_parent'    => get_the_ID(),
    'post_type'      => 'attachment',
    'post_mime_type' => 'image',
);
```

#### References

- `<a href="#reference/functions/get_posts">get_posts()</a>`
- `<a href="#reference/functions/get_children">get_children()</a>`
- `<a href="#reference/functions/wp_get_attachment_metadata">wp_get_attachment_metadata()</a>`

## Special considerations

### Compatible media formats

In the Media Library, you can upload any file (with the network administrator’s unfiltered\_upload) and not just images or videos but text files, office documents or even binary files. Single site administrators do not have the unfiltered\_upload capability by default and requires that definition to be set for the capability to kick in. Audio and Video files are processed by the internal library `MediaElement.js`.

- [Supported Audio format](#)
- [Supported Video format](#themes/functionality/media/video)

### Troubleshooting:

#### Cannot retrieve attachment

When you cannot get your attached media by `<a href="#reference/functions/get_posts">get_posts()</a>` or `<a href="#reference/functions/get_children">get_children()</a>` function, confirm your media is really attached to the post.  
From the [Administration Screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Screens), Click **Media &gt; Library** to open the Media Library and confirm the value in “Uploaded to” column of the media.

# Featured Images &amp; Post Thumbnails <a name="themes/functionality/featured-images-post-thumbnails" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/featured-images-post-thumbnails/

Featured images (also sometimes called Post Thumbnails) are images that represent an individual Post, Page, or Custom Post Type. When you create your Theme, you can output the featured image in a number of different ways, on your archive page, in your header, or above a post, for example.

## Enabling Support for Featured Image

Themes must declare support for the Featured Image function before the Featured Image interface will appear on the Edit screen. Support is declared by putting the following in your theme’s [functions.php](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/theme-basics/theme-functions/ "Theme Functions") file:

```php
add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' );
```

To enable Featured Image only for specific post types, see [add\_theme\_support()](#reference/functions/add_theme_support "Allows a theme to register its support of a certain feature...") 

## Setting a Featured Image

Once you add support for Featured Images, the Featured Image meta box will be visible on the appropriate content item’s Edit screens. If a user is unable to see it, they can enable it in their screen options.

By default, the Featured Image meta box is displayed in the sidebar of the Edit Post and Edit Page screens.

[![devhbook-featured_image](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/docs/files/2013/02/devhbook-featured_image1.png?ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/docs/files/2013/02/devhbook-featured_image1.png?ssl=1)## Function Reference

`<a href="#reference/functions/add_image_size" title="Register a new image size">add_image_size()</a>` – Register a new image size.  
`<a href="#reference/functions/set_post_thumbnail_size" title="Registers an image size for the post thumbnail">set_post_thumbnail_size()</a>` – Registers an image size for the post thumbnail.

`<a href="#reference/functions/has_post_thumbnail" title="Check if post has an image attached">has_post_thumbnail()</a>` – Check if post has an image attached.  
`<a href="#reference/functions/the_post_thumbnail" title="Display Post Thumbnail">the_post_thumbnail()</a>` – Display Post Thumbnail.

`<a href="#reference/functions/get_the_post_thumbnail" title="Retrieve Post Thumbnail">get_the_post_thumbnail()</a>` – Retrieve Post Thumbnail.  
`<a href="#reference/functions/get_post_thumbnail_id" title="Retrieve Post Thumbnail ID">get_post_thumbnail_id()</a>` – Retrieve Post Thumbnail ID.

## Image Sizes

The default image sizes of WordPress are “Thumbnail”, “Medium”, “Large” and “Full Size” (the original size of the image you uploaded). These image sizes can be configured in the WordPress Administration Media panel under **&gt;Settings &gt; Media**. You can also define your own image size by passing an array with your image dimensions:

```php
the_post_thumbnail(); // Without parameter ->; Thumbnail
the_post_thumbnail( 'thumbnail' ); // Thumbnail (default 150px x 150px max)
the_post_thumbnail( 'medium' ); // Medium resolution (default 300px x 300px max)
the_post_thumbnail( 'medium_large' ); // Medium-large resolution (default 768px x no height limit max)
the_post_thumbnail( 'large' ); // Large resolution (default 1024px x 1024px max)
the_post_thumbnail( 'full' ); // Original image resolution (unmodified)
the_post_thumbnail( array( 100, 100 ) ); // Other resolutions (height, width)
```

## Add Custom Featured Image Sizes

In addition to defining image sizes individually using

```php
the_post_thumbnail( array(  ,  ) );
```

you can create custom featured image sizes in your theme’s functions file that can then be called in your theme’s template files.

```php
add_image_size( 'category-thumb', 300, 9999 ); // 300 pixels wide (and unlimited height)
```

Here is an example of how to create custom Featured Image sizes in your theme’s `functions.php` file.

```php
if ( function_exists( 'add_theme_support' ) ) {
    add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' );
    set_post_thumbnail_size( 150, 150, true ); // default Featured Image dimensions (cropped)

    // additional image sizes
    // delete the next line if you do not need additional image sizes
    add_image_size( 'category-thumb', 300, 9999 ); // 300 pixels wide (and unlimited height)
}
```

## Set the Featured Image Output Size

To be used in the current Theme’s functions.php file.  
 You can use `set_post_thumbnail_size()` to set the default Featured Image size by resizing the image proportionally (that is, without distorting it):

```php
set_post_thumbnail_size( 50, 50 ); // 50 pixels wide by 50 pixels tall, resize mode
```

Set the default Featured Image size by cropping the image (either from the sides, or from the top and bottom):

```php
set_post_thumbnail_size( 50, 50, true ); // 50 pixels wide by 50 pixels tall, crop mode
```

## Styling Featured Images

Featured Images are given a class “wp-post-image”. They also get a class depending on the size of the thumbnail being displayed. You can style the output with these CSS selectors:

```css
img.wp-post-image
img.attachment-thumbnail
img.attachment-medium
img.attachment-large
img.attachment-full
```

You can also give Featured Images their own classes by using the attribute parameter in [the\_post\_thumbnail()](#reference/functions/the_post_thumbnail "Display Post Thumbnail").  
 Display the Featured Image with a class “alignleft”:

```php
the_post_thumbnail( 'thumbnail', array( 'class' => 'alignleft' ) );
```

## Examples

### Default Usage

```php
// check if the post or page has a Featured Image assigned to it.
if ( has_post_thumbnail() ) {
    the_post_thumbnail();
}
```

To return the Featured Image for use in your PHP code instead of displaying it, use: [get\_the\_post\_thumbnail()](#reference/functions/get_the_post_thumbnail "Retrieve Post Thumbnail")

```php
// check for a Featured Image and then assign it to a PHP variable for later use
if ( has_post_thumbnail() ) {
    $featured_image = get_the_post_thumbnail();
}
```

### Linking to Post Permalink or Larger Image

 Don’t use these two examples together in the same Theme.

Example 1. To link Post Thumbnails to the Post Permalink in a specific loop, use the following within your Theme’s template files:

```php
<?php if ( has_post_thumbnail()) : ?>
    <a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>" alt="<?php the_title_attribute(); ?>">
        <?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?>
    </a>
<?php endif; ?>
```

Example 2. To link **all Post Thumbnails** on your website to the Post Permalink, put this in the current Theme’s [functions.php](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/part-one-theme-basics/theme-functions/ "Theme Functions") file:

```php
add_filter( 'post_thumbnail_html', 'my_post_image_html', 10, 3 );
function my_post_image_html( $html, $post_id, $post_image_id ) {

  $html = '<a href="' . get_permalink( $post_id ) . '">' . $html . '</a>';
  return $html;

}
```

This example links to the “large” Post Thumbnail image size and must be used within The Loop.

```php
if ( has_post_thumbnail()) {
    $large_image_url = wp_get_attachment_image_src( get_post_thumbnail_id(), 'large');
    echo '<a href="' . $large_image_url[0] . '">';
    the_post_thumbnail('thumbnail');
    echo '</a>';
}
```

# Post Formats <a name="themes/functionality/post-formats" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/post-formats/

A Post Format is used by a theme for presenting posts in a certain format and style. The Post Formats feature provides a standardized list of formats available to all themes that support the feature. A theme may not support every format on the list; in such a case, it is good form to make this known to users.

A theme cannot introduce formats not on the standardized list, even through plugins. This standardization ensures compatibility between themes and a way for external tools to use the feature in a consistent fashion.

In short, with a theme that supports Post Formats, a blogger can change how a post looks by choosing a Post Format.

Using **Asides** as an example, in the past, a category called Asides was created, and posts were assigned that category, and then displayed differently based on styling rules from [post\_class()](#reference/functions/post_class) or from [in\_category(‘asides’)](#reference/functions/in_category).

With **Post Formats**, the new approach allows a theme to add support for a Post Format (e.g. [add\_theme\_support(‘post-formats’, array(‘aside’))](#reference/functions/add_theme_support)), and then the post format can be selected in the Publish meta box when saving the post. A function call of [get\_post\_format($post-&gt;ID)](#reference/functions/get_post_format) can be used to determine the format, and [post\_class()](#reference/functions/post_class) will also create the “format-asides” class, for pure-css styling.

## Supported Formats

The following Post Formats are available, if supported by the theme.

Note that while actual post content won’t change, the theme can display a post differently based on the format chosen. How posts are displayed is entirely up to the theme, but here are some general guidelines on typical uses for the different Post Formats.

- **aside** – Typically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.
- **gallery** – A gallery of images. Post will likely contain a gallery shortcode and will have image attachments.
- **link** – A link to another site. Themes may wish to use the first &lt;a href=””&gt; tag in the post content as the external link for that post. An alternative approach could be if the post consists only of a URL, then that will be the URL and the title (post\_title) will be the name attached to the anchor for it.
- **image** – A single image. The first &lt;img /&gt; tag in the post could be considered the image. Alternatively, if the post consists only of a URL, that will be the image URL and the title of the post (post\_title) will be the title attribute for the image.
- **quote** – A quotation. Probably will contain a blockquote holding the quote content. Alternatively, the quote may be just the content, with the source/author being the title.
- **status** – A short status update, similar to a Twitter status update.
- **video** – A single video. The first &lt;video /&gt; tag or object/embed in the post content could be considered the video. Alternatively, if the post consists only of a URL, that will be the video URL. May also contain the video as an attachment to the post, if video support is enabled on the blog (like via a plugin).
- **audio** – An audio file. Could be used for Podcasting.
- **chat** – A chat transcript, like so:

```bash
John: foo
Mary: bar
John: foo 2
```

When writing or editing a Post, “Standard” designates that no Post Format is specified. Also if an invalid format is specified, “Standard” (no format) is applied by default.

## Function Reference

### Main Functions

- [set\_post\_format()](#reference/functions/set_post_format)
- [get\_post\_format()](#reference/functions/get_post_format)
- [has\_post\_format()](#reference/functions/has_post_format)

### Other Functions

- [get\_post\_format\_link()](#reference/functions/get_post_format_link)
- [get\_post\_format\_string()](#reference/functions/get_post_format_string)

## Adding Theme Support

Themes need to use [add\_theme\_support()](#reference/functions/add_theme_support) in the *functions.php* file to tell WordPress which post formats to support by passing an array of formats like so:

```php
<?php
function themename_post_formats_setup() {
	add_theme_support( 'post-formats', array( 'aside', 'gallery' ) );
}
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'themename_post_formats_setup' );
```

The [after\_setup\_theme](#reference/hooks/after_setup_theme) hook is used so that the post formats support is registered after the theme has loaded.

## Adding Post Type Support

Post Types need to use [add\_post\_type\_support()](#reference/functions/add_post_type_support) in the *functions.php* file to tell WordPress which post formats to support:

```php
<?php
function themename_custom_post_formats_setup() {
	// add post-formats to post_type 'page'
	add_post_type_support( 'page', 'post-formats' );
	// add post-formats to post_type 'my_custom_post_type'
	add_post_type_support( 'my_custom_post_type', 'post-formats' );
}
add_action( 'init', 'themename_custom_post_formats_setup' );
```

Or in the function [register\_post\_type()](#reference/functions/register_post_type), add ‘post-formats’, in ‘supports’ parameter array:

```php
<?php
$args = array(
	'supports' => array( 'title', 'editor', 'author', 'post-formats' ),
);
register_post_type( 'book', $args );
```

[add\_post\_type\_support](#reference/functions/add_post_type_support) should be hooked to [init](#reference/hooks/init) hook, as custom post types may not have been registered at [after\_setup\_theme](#reference/hooks/after_setup_theme).

## Using Formats

In the theme, use [get\_post\_format()](#reference/functions/get_post_format) to check the format for a post, and change its presentation accordingly. Note that posts with the default format will return a value of FALSE. Alternatively, use the [has\_post\_format()](#reference/functions/has_post_format) [conditional tag](#themes/basics/conditional-tags):

```php
<?php
if ( has_post_format( 'video' ) ) {
	echo 'This is the video format.';
}
```

### Suggested Styling

An alternate approach to formats is through styling rules. Themes should use the [post\_class()](#reference/functions/post_class) function in the wrapper code that surrounds the post to add dynamic styling classes. Post formats will cause extra classes to be added in this manner, using the “format-foo” name.

For example, one could hide post titles from status format posts by putting this in your theme’s stylesheet:

```css
.format-status .post-title {
     display: none;
}
```

Each of the formats lend themselves to a certain type of “style”, as dictated by modern usage. It is well to keep in mind the intended usage for each format when applying styles.

For example, the aside, link, and status formats are simple, short, and minor. These will typically be displayed without title or author information. The aside could contain perhaps a paragraph or two, while the link would be only a sentence with a link to a URL in it. Both the link and aside might have a link to the single post page (using [the\_permalink()](#reference/functions/the_permalink)) and would thus allow comments, but the status format very likely would not have such a link.

An image post, on the other hand, would typically just contain a single image, with or without a caption/text to go along with it. An audio/video post would be the same but with audio/video added in. Any of these three could use either plugins or standard [Embeds](https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) to display their content. Titles and authorship might not be displayed for them either, as the content could be self-explanatory.

The quote format is especially well suited to posting a simple quote from a person with no extra information. If you were to put the quote into the post content alone, and put the quoted person’s name into the title of the post, then you could style the post so as to display [the\_content()](#reference/functions/the_content) by itself but restyled into a blockquote format, and use [the\_title()](#reference/functions/the_title) to display the quoted person’s name as the byline.

A chat in particular will probably tend towards a monospaced type display, in many cases. With some styling on the .format-chat, you can make it display the content of the post using a monospaced font, perhaps inside a gray background div or similar, thus distinguishing it visually as a chat session.

### Formats in a Child Theme

[Child Themes](#themes/advanced-topics/child-themes) inherit the post formats defined by the parent theme. Calling [add\_theme\_support()](#reference/functions/add_theme_support) for post formats in a child theme must be done at a later priority than that of the parent theme and will **override** the existing list, not add to it.

```php
<?php
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'childtheme_formats', 11 );
function childtheme_formats() {
	 add_theme_support( 'post-formats', array( 'aside', 'gallery', 'link' ) );
}
```

Calling [remove\_theme\_support(‘post-formats’)](#reference/functions/remove_theme_support) will remove it all together.

# Internationalization <a name="themes/functionality/internationalization" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/internationalization/

## What is internationalization?

Internationalization is the process of developing your theme, so it can easily be translated into other languages. Internationalization is often abbreviated as `i18n` (because there are 18 letters between the letters i and n).

## Why is internationalization important?

WordPress is used all over the world, in countries where English is not the main language. The strings in the WordPress plugins need to be coded in a special way so that can be easily translated into other languages. As a developer, you may not be able to provide localizations for all your users; however, a translator can successfully localize the theme without needing to modify the source code itself.

## How to internationalize your theme?

For the text in the theme to be able to be translated easily the text should not be hardcoded in the theme but be passed as an argument through one of the localization functions in WordPress.

The following example could not be translated unless the translator modified the source code which is not very efficient.

```php
<h1>Settings Page</h1>
```

By passing the string through a localization function it can it can be easily parsed to be translated.

```php
<h1><?php _e( 'Settings Page' ); ?></h1>
```

WordPress uses [gettext](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) libraries to be able to add the translations in PHP. In WordPress you should use the WordPress localization functions instead of the native PHP gettext-compliant translation functions.

### Text Domain

The text domain is the second argument that is used in the internationalization functions. The text domain is a unique identifier, allowing WordPress to distinguish between all of the loaded translations. The text domain is only needed to be defined for themes and plugins.

Themes that are hosted on WordPress.org the text domain must match the slug of your theme URL (`wordpress.org/themes/<slug>`). This is needed so that the translations from [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/) work correctly.

The text domain name must use dashes and not underscores and be lowercase. For example, if the theme’s name `My Theme` is defined in the `style.css` or it is contained in a folder called `my-theme` the text domain should be `my-theme`.

The text domain is used in three different places:

1. In the `style.css` theme header
2. As an argument in the localization functions
3. As an argument when loading the translations using `load_theme_textdomain()` or `load_child_theme_textdomain()`

#### style.css theme header

The text domain is added to the `style.css` header so that the theme meta-data like the description can be translated even when the theme is not enabled. The text domain should be same as the one used when [loading the text domain](#loading-text-domain).

**Example:**

```php
/*
* Theme Name: My Theme
* Author: Theme Author
* Text Domain: my-theme
*/
```

##### Domain Path

The domain path is needed when the translations are saved in a directory other than `languages` . This is so that WordPress knows where to find the translation when the theme is not activated. For example, if .mo files are located in the languages folder then Domain Path will be `/languages` and must be written with the first slash. Defaults to the `languages` folder in the theme.

**Example:**

```php
/*
* Theme Name: My Theme
* Author: Theme Author
* Text Domain: my-theme
* Domain Path: /languages
*/
```

#### Add text domain to strings

The text domain should be added as an argument to all of the localization functions for the translations to work correctly.

**Example 1**:

```php
__( 'Post' )
```

should become

```php
__( 'Post', 'my-theme' )
```

**Example 2**:

```php
_e( 'Post' )
```

should become

```php
_e( 'Post', 'my-theme' )
```

**Example 3**:

```php
_n( '%s post', '%s posts', $count )
```

should become

```php
_n( '%s post', '%s posts', $count, 'my-theme' )
```

The text domain should be passed as a string to the localization functions instead of a variable. It allows parsing tools to differentiate between text domains. Example of what not to do:  
```php
__( 'Translate me.' , $text_domain );
```

  

#### Loading Translations

The translations in WordPress are saved in `.po` and `.mo` files which need to be loaded. They can be loaded by using the functions `<a href="#reference/functions/load_theme_textdomain">load_theme_textdomain()</a>` or `<a href="#reference/functions/load_child_theme_textdomain">load_child_theme_textdomain()</a>`. This loads `{locale}.mo` from your theme’s base directory or `{text-domain}-{locale}.mo` from the WordPress theme language folder in `/wp-content/languages/themes/`.

As of version 4.6 WordPress automatically checks the language directory in `wp-content` for translations from [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/). This means that plugins that are translated via translate.wordpress.org do not require `load_plugin_textdomain()` anymore.  
If you don’t want to add a `load_plugin_textdomain()` call to your plugin you should set the `Requires at least:` field in your readme.txt to 4.6.  

To find out more about the different language and country codes, see [the list of languages](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/ "https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language").

**Watch Out**

- Name your MO file as `{locale}.mo` (e.g. de\_DE.po &amp; de\_DE.mo) if adding the translation to the theme folder.
- Name your MO file as `{text-domain}-{locale}.mo` (e.g my-theme-de\_DE.po &amp; my-theme-de\_DE.mo) if you are adding the translation to the WordPress theme language folder.

**Example:**

```php
function my_theme_load_theme_textdomain() {
    load_theme_textdomain( 'my-theme', get_template_directory() . '/languages' );
}
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'my_theme_load_theme_textdomain' );
```

This function should ideally be run within the theme’s `function.php`.

##### Language Packs

If you’re interested in language packs and how the import to [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/) is working, please read the [Meta Handbook page about Translations](https://make.wordpress.org/meta/handbook/documentation/translations/).

## Internationalizing your theme

Now that your translations are loaded, you can start writing every string in your theme with Internationalization functions.

Check the [Internationalization](#apis/handbook/internationalization) page on the [Common APIs Handbook](#apis) for more information and best practices.

## What is localization?

Localization describes the subsequent process of translating an internationalized theme. Localization is abbreviated as `l10n` (because there are 10 letters between the l and the n.)

Please refer to the [Localization](#apis/handbook/internationalization/localization) page on the [Common APIs handbook](#apis) to learn how to Localize your theme.

# Accessibility <a name="themes/functionality/accessibility" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/accessibility/

A WordPress theme should generate pages everyone can use, including those who cannot see or use a mouse.

To create an accessible theme, you need to have knowledge of web standards for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
You also need to be aware of best practices for web accessibility and have basic knowledge of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/), WCAG.

To succeed in making your theme accessible, accessibility should be considered from the start of your project as part of your project specification. By making the right decisions from the beginning, you can avoid making last-minute adjustments that can be costly, time-consuming, and of low quality.

The [Accessibility Team](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/) have documented many of the best practices and resources for development, design, and content in their handbook. In the handbook, you can also learn about testing for accessibility.

The [Themes Team](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/) has two sets of accessibility requirements for themes submitted to the WordPress.org theme directory:

- [Requirements for all themes](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/#3-accessibility)
- [Requirements for using the “‘accessibility-ready” tag](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/)

The accessibility-ready requirements are based on WCAG but adapted for WordPress themes.

“Accessibility Ready” does **not** mean that the theme meets the WCAG guidelines [AA-level](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/make/which-questions-should-you-ask/#levels-of-accessibility). It means that the theme reaches the minimum standards that the theme review team has set.

## The four principles of web accessibility

Although web accessibility can be a complex subject, it boils down to only four principles. The content must be:

### Perceivable

Content must be available to all. It should not depend on a specific device or browser or require a specific physical sense, such as sight or sound.

### Operable

Users must be able to move around and operate the final site effectively, whether they’re using a keyboard, a mouse, or assistive technology.

### Understandable

The content should be presented in a manner that supports understanding, including supporting the construction of a mental model of the site for screen reader users. Similarly, the site’s operation (navigation menus, links, forms, etc.) should be easily understandable. Building a theme that incorporates known user behaviors (such as underlining links within the main content area) helps in this respect.

### Robust

Content must be equally available across a wide range of user agents. Disabled users may employ a range of hardware and software solutions (commonly referred to as “assistive technology”) to allow them to access the Web—including screen reading &amp; voice recognition software, braille readers, and switches (single input devices).

A theme designed with these four principles in mind eases the creation of an accessible website.

---

## Perceivable and understandable

### Color and color contrast

Having a high enough color contrast between background and foreground colors makes content easier to read. Theme authors must ensure that all background/foreground color contrasts for plain content text are within the level AA contrast ratio (4.5:1) specified in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 for color luminosity.

- Color may not be the only way to identify controls, links in text content, or error messages.
- If there is no text decoration on linked text, there must be a 3:1 color contrast between the link text color and the surrounding non-link text color, in addition to the other color contrast requirements.

There are separate requirements for links in content (links surrounded by other text) and links that are grouped together in navigation menus. Groups of links do not need to be underlined if it is obvious from the context that they are links.

[Best practices for the use of color](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/design/use-of-color/)

[Accessibility-ready requirements for contrast](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#contrasts)

### Resizable text

Users have many means to resize text, including browser settings. All content and functionality must remain available if the user resizes the text up to 200% of the original size.

- Resizing text must not trigger multi-dimensional scrolling
- Enlarged texts must not cause overflows or overlaps

To avoid these issues, it is recommended to:

- Use a relative unit for font sizes and line heights
- Test your theme in different browsers and screen widths

[Best practices for font sizes and resized text](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/design/font-sizes-and-resize-text/)

### Images

#### Non-decorative images

Example:

- A header image that replaces header text
- Images used in place of text for navigation

Non-decorative images included with `img` elements should have an `alt` attribute.

#### Decorative images

Example:

- A header image used alongside header text
- Images and icons accompanying navigation text links

When possible, decorative images should be included using CSS.

- Decorative images included with `img` elements should have an empty `alt` attribute: `alt=""`.
- Decorative images that are displayed together with text should be hidden from screen readers using `aria-hidden`.

#### Featured images

The alt attribute for featured images is defined in the media library.

- If the featured image is unlinked, the alt attribute should describe the image
- If the featured image is linked to a post, the alt text should use the post title

[Best practices for alt texts](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/content/alternative-text-for-images/)

[Accessibility-ready requirement for images](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#images)

## Operable

### Controls

All controls must be usable with the keyboard on all screen sizes, including but not limited to buttons for opening and closing menus, submenus, any type of dialog, modal, and popup.

[Best practices for dialog modals](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/markup/dialog-modal/)

[Accessibility-ready requirements for controls](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#controls)

### Headings

Headings are an essential way of breaking content down into logical sub-sections. Heading levels indicate the importance of the content. Screen reader users can scan the contents of a page by reading the headings, and navigating to a section via its heading. That is why it is important that headings are used logically and not for presentational purposes.

[Best practices for Heading structure in theme development](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/markup/heading-structure-in-theme-development/)

[Accessibility-ready requirements for headings](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#headings)

### Links

#### Link text

Link text should describe the resource that it links to, even when the text is read out of context. Some assistive software scans a page for links and presents them to the user as a simple list. In these situations, all the links will be read out of context. So it is important the text used in a link is descriptive. Bare URLs should never be used as links.

[Good link texts](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/content/good-link-texts/)

[Accessibility-ready requirements: Avoiding repetitive Read More or Continue reading texts.](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#repetitive-link-text)

#### Link underlining and styling link states

Generally speaking, links should be underlined if they are outside navigation menus and lists. Using color alone to distinguish links is insufficient as not everyone can perceive color.

Users must be able to tell if a text is linked if they are hovering over a link, if they are focusing on a link, and if they have already visited a link. The default browser style for the focus state should not be removed unless replaced with a more visible focus style.

[Accessibility-ready requirements for underlining links in the content](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#content-links)

#### Skip Links

Skip links provide a mechanism that enables users to navigate directly to content or navigation on entering any given page. For example, a skip to content link might allow a user to skip a header area and go directly to the main content.

In designs with multiple menus and content areas, multiple skip links can be used:

- Skip to the main navigation
- Skip to content
- Skip to footer

These links may be positioned off-screen initially using an appropriate CSS technique but should remain available to screen reader users and be visible on focus for sighted keyboard navigators.

[Best practices for Skip Links](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/markup/skip-links/)

[Accessibility-ready requirements for Skip Links](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#skip-links)

### Forms

- Provide enough information for the user to be able to complete the form.
- All input fields must have a label. A placeholder text is not a replacement for the label. Input fields must also have a visible focus style.
- Group controls that belong together, for example, a set of related checkboxes, with a `fieldset` and `legend`.
- Make sure that the tab order in the form matches the visual order of the input fields: Do not move focus unexpectedly or skip past input fields.

#### On Form Submission

Post-submission responses—including any error messages—should always be perceivable. If possible, error messages should be generated at the top of the post-submission page so the user is immediately aware of any issues. Error messages should also make sense when read out of context.

[Best practices for forms](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/markup/web-forms/)

[Accessibility-ready requirements for forms](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#forms)

## Robust

Use the HTML element that is the best match for the content. Use buttons when performing an action, and links when navigating to a part of a page or a new page.

- The content of the website should be available even if the user disables both JavaScript and CSS
- Establish which [browsers](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/browser-support/) your theme supports and test your theme with these browsers on different screen sizes

# Administration Menus <a name="themes/functionality/administration-menus" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/administration-menus/

This is no longer the recommended way to work with theme options. The [Customizer API](#themes/customize-api) is the recommended way to give more control and flexibility to your users

Theme authors might need to provide a settings screen, so users can customize how their theme is used or works. The best way to do this is to create an administration menu item that allows the user to access that settings screen from all the administration screens.

## Function Reference

### Menu Pages

## Every Plot Needs a Hook

To add an administration menu, there are three things you need to do:

1. Create a function that contains the menu-building code.
2. Register the above function using the `admin_menu` action hook – or `network_admin_menu`, if you are adding a menu for the Network.
3. Create the HTML output for the screen, displayed when the menu item is clicked.

Most developers overlook the second step in this list. You can’t simply call the menu code. You need to put it **inside a function**, and then register this function.

Here is a simple example of these three steps described. This will add a sub-level menu item under the Settings top-level menu. When selected, that menu item will show a very basic screen.

```php
<?php
/** Step 2 (from text above). */
add_action( 'admin_menu', 'my_menu' );

/** Step 1. */
function my_menu() {
	add_options_page(
		'My Options',
		'My Menu',
		'manage_options',
		'my-unique-identifier',
		'my_options'
	);
}

/** Step 3. */
function my_options() {
	if ( ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) ) {
		wp_die( __( 'You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page.' ) );
	}
	echo 'Here is where I output the HTML for my screen.';
	echo '</div>';
}
```

In this example, the function `my_menu()` adds a new item to the Settings administration menu via the [`add_options_page()`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_options_page) function.

*Note:* Note that the [add\_action()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_action) call in Step 2 *registers* the my\_menu() function under the [admin\_menu](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/admin_menu) hook. **Without that, [add\_action()](#reference/functions/add_action) call, a PHP error for undefined function will be thrown**. Finally, the `add_options_page()` call refers to the `my_options()` function which contains the actual page to be displayed (and PHP code to be processed) when someone clicks the menu item.

These steps are described in more detail in the sections below. Remember to enclose the creation of the menu and the page in functions, and use the `admin_menu` [hook](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference) to get the whole process started at the right time.

## Determining Location for New Menus

Before creating a new menu, first decide if the menu should be a **top-level** menu, or a **sub-level** menu item. A top-level menu displays as new section in the administration menus and contains sub-level menu items. This means a sub-level menu item is a member of an existing top-level menu.

It is rare that a theme would require the creation of a new top-level menu. If the theme introduces an entirely new concept to WordPress and needs many screens to do it, then that theme may warrant a new top-level menu. Adding a top-level menu should only be considered if you really need multiple, related screens to make WordPress do something it was not originally designed to accomplish. Examples of new top-level menus might include job management or conference management. Please note that, with the native [post type](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post_Type) registration, WordPress automatically creates top-level menus to manage this kind of features.

If the creation of a top-level menu is not necessary, you need to decide under what top-level menu to place your new sub-level menu item. As a point of reference, several themes add sub-level menu items underneath existing WordPress top-level menus.

Use this guide of the WordPress top-level menus to determine the correct location for your sub-level menu item:

- Dashboard – information central for your site and include the Updates option for updating WordPress core, plugins, and themes.
- Posts – displays tools for writing posts (time oriented content).
- Media – uploading and managing your pictures, videos, and audio.
- Links – manage references to other blogs and sites of interest.
- Pages – displays tools for writing your static content called pages.
- Comments – controlling and regulation reader to responses to posts.
- Appearance – displays controls for manipulation of theme/style files, sidebars, etc.
- Plugins – displays controls dealing with plugin management, not configuration options for a plugin itself.
- Users – displays controls for user management.
- Tools – manage the export, import, and even backup of blog data.
- Settings – displays plugin options that only administrators should view.
- Network Admin – displays plugin options that are set on the Network. Instead of `admin_menu`, you should use `network_admin_menu` (see also [Create A Network](https://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network))

### Top-Level Menus

If you have decided your theme requires a brand-new top-level menu, the first thing you’ll need to do is to create one with the `add_menu_page()` function. *Note:* skip to [Sub-Level Menus](#sub-level-menus) if you don’t need a top-level menu.

Parameter values:

- `page_title` – the text to be displayed in the title tags of the page when the menu is selected.
- `menu_title` – the on-screen name text for the menu.
- `capability` – the capability required for this menu to be displayed to the user. When using the Settings API to handle your form, you should use `manage_options` here as the user won’t be able to save options without it. User levels are deprecated and should not be used here.
- `menu_slug` – the slug name to refer to this menu by (should be unique for this menu). Prior to Version 3.0 this was called the file (or handle) parameter. If the function parameter is omitted, the `menu_slug` should be the PHP file that handles the display of the menu page content.
- `function` – the function that displays the page content for the menu page.
- `icon_url` – the URL to the icon to be used for this menu. This parameter is optional.
- `position` – the position in the menu order this menu should appear. By default, if this parameter is omitted, the menu will appear at the bottom of the menu structure. To see the current menu positions, use `print_r( $GLOBALS[ 'menu' ] )` after the menu has loaded.
- Sub-Level Menus – once your top-level menu is defined, or you have chosen to use an existing WordPress top-level menu, you are ready to define one or more sub-level menu items using the `add_submenu_page()` function.

### Sub-Level Menus

If you want your new menu item to be a sub-menu item, you can create it using the `add_submenu_page()` function instead.

Parameter values:

- `parent_slug` – the slug name for the parent menu, or the file name of a standard WordPress admin file that supplies the top-level menu in which you want to insert your sub-menu, or your plugin file if this sub-menu is going into a custom top-level menu. Examples: 
    - Dashboard – `add_submenu_page('index.php', ...)`
    - Posts – `add_submenu_page('edit.php', ...)`
    - Media – `add_submenu_page('upload.php', ...)`
    - Links – `add_submenu_page('link-manager.php', ...)`
    - Pages – `add_submenu_page('edit.php?post_type=page', ...)`
    - Comments – `add_submenu_page('edit-comments.php', ...)`
    - Custom Post Types – `add_submenu_page('edit.php?post_type=your_post_type', ...)`
    - Appearance – `add_submenu_page('themes.php', ...)`
    - Plugins – `add_submenu_page('plugins.php', ...)`
    - Users – `add_submenu_page('users.php', ...)`
    - Tools – `add_submenu_page('tools.php', ...)`
    - Settings – `add_submenu_page('options-general.php', ...)`
- `page_title` – text that will go into the HTML page title for the page when the submenu is active.
- `menu_title` – the text to be displayed in the title tags of the page when the menu is selected.
- `capability` – the capability required for this menu to be displayed to the user. User levels are deprecated and should not be used here.
- `menu_slug` – for existing WordPress menus, the PHP file that handles the display of the menu page content. For sub-menus of a custom top-level menu, a unique identifier for this sub-menu page.
- `function` – the function that displays the page content for the menu page. Technically, as in the `add_menu_page` function, the function parameter is optional, but if it is not supplied, then WordPress will basically assume that including the PHP file will generate the administration screen, without calling a function.

### Using Wrapper Functions

Since most sub-level menus belong under the Settings, Tools, or Appearance menus, WordPress supplies wrapper functions that make adding a sub-level menu items to these top-level menus easier. Note that the function names may not match the names seen in the admin UI as they have changed over time:

#### Dashboard

```php
<?php
add_dashboard_page(
	$page_title,
	$menu_title,
	$capability,
	$menu_slug,
	$function
);
```

#### Posts

```php
<?php
add_posts_page(
	$page_title,
	$menu_title,
	$capability,
	$menu_slug,
	$function
);
```

#### Media

```php
<?php
add_media_page(
	$page_title,
	$menu_title,
	$capability,
	$menu_slug,
	$function
);
```

#### Links

```php
<?php
add_links_page(
	$page_title,
	$menu_title,
	$capability,
	$menu_slug,
	$function
);
```

#### Pages

```php
<?php
add_pages_page(
	$page_title,
	$menu_title,
	$capability,
	$menu_slug,
	$function
);
```

#### Comments

```php
add_comments_page(
	$page_title,
	$menu_title,
	$capability,
	$menu_slug,
	$function
);
```

#### Appearance

```php
<?php
add_theme_page(
	$page_title,
	$menu_title,
	$capability,
	$menu_slug,
	$function
);
```

#### Plugins

```php
<?php
add_plugins_page(
	$page_title,
	$menu_title,
	$capability,
	$menu_slug,
	$function
);
```

#### Users

```php
<?php
add_users_page(
	$page_title,
	$menu_title,
	$capability,
	$menu_slug,
	$function
);
```

#### Tools

```php
<?php
add_management_page(
	$page_title,
	$menu_title,
	$capability,
	$menu_slug,
	$function
);
```

#### Settings

```php
<?php
add_options_page(
	$page_title,
	$menu_title,
	$capability,
	$menu_slug,
	$function
);
```

Also see [Theme Options](#themes/customize-api) for the currently recommended way of creating options via the Customizer API.

### Example

Here’s a quick example illustrating how to insert a top-level menu page and a sub-menu page, where the title on the sub-menu page is different from the top-level page. In this example, `register_my_theme_more_settings_menu` is the name of the function that displays the first sub-menu page:

```php
<?php
function register_my_theme_settings_menu() {
	add_menu_page(
		"My Theme's Settings",
		'My Theme',
		'manage_options',
		'my-theme-settings-menu'
	);
}

function register_my_theme_more_settings_menu() {
	add_submenu_page(
		'my-theme-settings-menu',
		'More Settings for My Theme',
		'More Settings',
		'manage_options',
		'my-theme-more-settings-menu'
	);
}

add_action( 'admin_menu', 'register_my_theme_settings_menu' );
add_action( 'admin_menu', 'register_my_theme_more_settings_menu' );
```

Here’s an example of adding an option page under a custom post type menu block (see also here):

CODE

## Inserting the Pages

Here is an example of how to insert multiple menus into various places:

```php
<?php
// Hook for adding admin menus
add_action( 'admin_menu', 'mt_add_pages' );

// Action function for hook above
function mt_add_pages() {
	// Add a new submenu under Settings:
	add_options_page( __( 'Test Settings', 'menu-test' ), __( 'Test Settings', 'menu-test' ), 'manage_options', 'testsettings', 'mt_settings_page' );

	// Add a new submenu under Tools:
	add_management_page( __( 'Test Tools', 'menu-test' ), __( 'Test Tools', 'menu-test' ), 'manage_options', 'testtools', 'mt_tools_page' );

	// Add a new top-level menu (ill-advised):
	add_menu_page( __( 'Test Toplevel', 'menu-test' ), __( 'Test Top-level', 'menu-test' ), 'manage_options', 'mt-top-level-handle', 'mt_toplevel_page' );

	// Add a submenu to the custom top-level menu:
	add_submenu_page( 'mt-top-level-handle', __( 'Test Sub-Level', 'menu-test' ), __( 'Test Sub-Level', 'menu-test' ), 'manage_options', 'sub-page', 'mt_sublevel_page' );

	// Add a second submenu to the custom top-level menu:
	add_submenu_page( 'mt-top-level-handle', __( 'Test Sub-Level 2', 'menu-test' ), __( 'Test Sub-Level 2', 'menu-test' ), 'manage_options', 'sub-page2', 'mt_sublevel_page2' );
}

// mt_settings_page() displays the page content for the Test settings sub-menu.
function mt_settings_page() {
	echo '<h2>' . __( 'Test Settings', 'menu-test' ) . '</h2>';
}

// mt_tools_page() displays the page content for the Test Tools sub-menu.
function mt_tools_page() {
	echo '<h2>' . __( 'Test Tools', 'menu-test' ) . '</h2>';
}

// mt_toplevel_page() displays the page content for the custom Test Top-Level menu.
function mt_toplevel_page() {
	echo '<h2>' . __( 'Test Top-Level', 'menu-test' ) . '</h2>';
}

// mt_sublevel_page() displays the page content for the first sub-menu of the custom Test Toplevel menu.
function mt_sublevel_page() {
	echo '<h2>' . __( 'Test Sub-Level', 'menu-test' ) . '</h2>';
}

// mt_sublevel_page2() displays the page content for the second sub-menu of the custom Test Top-Level menu.
function mt_sublevel_page2() {
	echo '<h2>' . __( 'Test Sub-Level 2', 'menu-test' ) . '</h2>';
}
```

## Sample Menu Page

*Note:* See the [Settings API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_API) for information on creating settings pages.

The previous example contains several dummy functions, such as `mt_settings_page()`, as placeholders for actual page content. Let’s expand on them. What if you wanted to create an option called `mt_favorite_color` that allows the site owner to type in their favorite color via a Settings page? The `mt_options_page()` function will need to output a data entry form on the screen, as well as to process the entered data.

Here is a function that does this:

```php
<?php
// mt_settings_page() displays the page content for the Test settings sub-menu.
function mt_settings_page() {
	// Must check that the user has the required capability.
	if ( ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) ) {
		wp_die( __( 'You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page.' ) );
	}

	// Variables for the field and option names
	$opt_name          = 'mt_favorite_color';
	$hidden_field_name = 'mt_submit_hidden';
	$data_field_name   = 'mt_favorite_color';

	// Read in existing option value from database
	$opt_val = get_option( $opt_name );

	// See if the user has posted us some information. If they did, this hidden field will be set to 'Y'.
	if ( isset( $_POST[ $hidden_field_name ] ) && $_POST[ $hidden_field_name ] == 'Y' ) {
		// Read their posted value.
		$opt_val = $_POST[ $data_field_name ];

		// Save the posted value in the database.
		update_option( $opt_name, $opt_val );

		// Put a "Settings updated" message on the screen
		?>
		<div class="updated"></div><!-- .updated -->

		<div class="wrap">
			<?php echo '<h2>' . __( 'Menu Test Settings', 'menu-test' ) . '</h2>'; ?>
			<form action="" method="post" name="form1"></form>
			<?php _e( 'Favorite Color:', 'menu-test' ); ?>
			<hr />
		</div><!-- .wrap -->

		<?php
	}
}
```

**A few notes:**

- The WordPress functions such as `add_menu_page()` and `add_submenu_page()` take a capability which will be used to determine whether the top-level or sub-level menu is displayed.
- The function which is hooked in to handle the output of the page must check that the user has the required capability as well.
- The WordPress administration functions take care of validating the user login, so you don’t have to worry about it in your function.
- The function example above has been internationalized — see the [I18n for WordPress Developers](https://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers) for more details.
- The function processes any entered data before putting the data entry form on the screen, so that the new values will be shown in the form (rather than the values from the database).
- You don’t have to worry about this working the first time, because the WordPress `update_option` function will automatically add an option to the database if it doesn’t already exist.
- These admin-menu-adding procedures are parsed every single time you navigate to a page in Admin. So if you are writing a theme which has no options page, but add one later, you can just add it using the instructions above and re-upload, and tweak until you’re happy with it. In other words, menus are not “permanently added” or put into a database upon activating a theme. They’re parsed on the fly, so you can add or subtract menu items at will, re-upload, and the change will be reflected right away.

## Page Hook Suffix

Every function that adds a new administration menu – `add_menu_page()`, `add_submenu_page()` and its specialized versions such as `add_options_page()` – returns a special value called **Page Hook Suffix**. It can be used later as a hook to which an action called only on that particular page can be registered.

One such action hook is `load-{page_hook}`, where `{page_hook}` is the value returned by one of these `add_*_page()` functions. This hook is called when the particular page is loaded. In the example below, it is used to display the “Theme is not configured” notice on all admin pages except for plugin’s options page:

```php
<?php
add_action( 'admin_menu', 'my_menu' );

// Here you can check if plugin is configured (e.g. check if some option is set). If not, add new hook.
// In this example hook is always added.
add_action( 'admin_notices', 'my_admin_notices' );

function my_menu() {
	// Add the new admin menu and page and save the returned hook suffix
	$hook_suffix = add_options_page( 'My Options', 'My Theme', 'manage_options', 'my-unique-identifier', 'my_options' );
	// Use the hook suffix to compose the hook and register an action executed when plugin's options page is loaded
	add_action( 'load-' . $hook_suffix, 'my_load_function' );
}

function my_load_function() {
	// Current admin page is the options page for our plugin, so do not display the notice
	// (remove the action responsible for this)
	remove_action( 'admin_notices', 'my_admin_notices' );
}

function my_admin_notices() {
	echo '<div class="updated fade" id="notice">My Plugin is not configured yet. Please do it now.</div>';
}

function my_options() {
	if ( ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) ) {
		wp_die( __( 'You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page.' ) );
	}

	echo '<div class="wrap">';
	echo 'Here is where the form would go if I actually had options.';
	echo '</div>';
}
```

# 404 Pages <a name="themes/functionality/404-pages" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/404-pages/

A 404 page is important to add into your theme in case a user stumbles upon a page that doesn’t exist or hasn’t been created yet. It is also important that your 404 page gives your visitors a way to arrive at the right place.

These next few steps will help you build a useful 404 page for your WordPress theme.

## Creating the 404.php file

As the `404.php` file is used on a page not found error, the first step is to create a file named `404.php` and add it to your WordPress theme folder.

Often times a great starting point for your `404.php` is your `index.php`

## Add a file header

To use your theme’s `header.php` file, open your `404.php` file. At the top, add a comment describing what the file is and make sure you include your theme’s header.

For example:

```php
/**
 * The template for displaying 404 pages (Not Found)
 */
get_header();
```

## Adding the body to your 404 Page

To make the 404 page functional you have to add the body content to your template:

Example:

```php
<div id="primary" class="content-area">
		<div id="content" class="site-content" role="main">

			<header class="page-header">
				<h1 class="page-title"><?php _e( 'Not Found', 'twentythirteen' ); ?></h1>
			</header>

			<div class="page-wrapper">
				<div class="page-content">
					<h2><?php _e( 'This is somewhat embarrassing, isn’t it?', 'twentythirteen' ); ?></h2>
					<p><?php _e( 'It looks like nothing was found at this location. Maybe try a search?', 'twentythirteen' ); ?></p>

					<?php get_search_form(); ?>
				</div><!-- .page-content -->
			</div><!-- .page-wrapper -->

		</div><!-- #content -->
	</div><!-- #primary -->
```

This example is from the Twenty Thirteen theme that comes with WordPress. This adds some text and a search form in the 404 page.

You can to add your own text to make your 404 page look better.

## Adding the footer and sidebar.

The final step when creating a 404 page is to add the footer. You may also add a sidebar if you want.

Example:

```php
get_sidebar();
get_footer();
```

Now you have a functional 404 page with a search form and some text in case a user stumbles upon the wrong page. Once you make sure the `404.php` has been uploaded, you can test your 404 page. Just type a URL address for your website that doesn’t exist. You can try something like `http://example.com/fred.php`. This is sure to result in a 404 error unless you actually have a PHP file called `fred.php`.``

# Child Themes <a name="themes/advanced-topics/child-themes" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/

Child themes are extensions of a parent theme. They allow you to modify an existing theme without directly editing that theme’s code. They are often something as simple as a few minor color changes, but they can also be complex and include custom overrides of the parent theme.

In this article, you will learn what parent and child themes are, how to create your own modifications via child themes, and what pieces of a parent theme that can be overridden.

## What are parent and child themes?

### Parent themes

All themes—unless they are specifically a child theme—are technically parent themes. Basically, this means that they are complete themes that can be installed and activated in WordPress.

Parent themes must have all of the required files, as outlined in the [Theme Structure](#themes/core-concepts/theme-structure) documentation. Beyond that, you don’t have to do anything special for your theme to *become a parent theme.*

### Child themes

A child theme includes everything from its parent theme by default. This includes the design and any of its functionality. But it can also be used to make customizations to the parent theme without directly modifying the parent theme’s files. This means that you (or your child theme’s users) can still receive updates to the parent theme without losing those modifications.

Child themes:

- Make your modifications portable and replicable.
- Keep customizations separate from the parent theme.
- Allow parent themes to be updated without losing your modifications.
- Save on development time since you’re only writing the code you need.
- Are a great way to start your journey toward developing full themes.

It’s worth noting that making extensive customizations from within a child theme can eventually become a management headache. For these more extensive projects, it is often better to fork the original theme and create a full/parent theme of your own. This is something you will need to decide on a case-by-case basis.

### What about grandchild themes?

This is not currently possible. There are only two levels to the standard theme hierarchy: parent and child theme.

However, when building block themes, there are other levels to what is presented on the front end of a site (they are just not a part of the theme layer):

- WordPress itself (default `theme.json`)
- Parent theme
- Child theme
- User customizations (can override `theme.json`, templates, and patterns)

In a way, the user customization layer works as a “grandchild” theme of sorts. The big difference is that the changes are stored in the database instead of the filesystem.

Outside of that, there is no standard method of creating an installable grandchild theme.

## How to create a child theme

Let’s try creating a child theme of the default [Twenty Twenty-Four](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfour/) theme bundled with WordPress.

### Create a child theme folder

First, your child theme needs a name. This can be whatever you want your theme to be called, but for this guide, let’s name it “Grand Sunrise.”

Now create a new folder in your `wp-content/themes` directory with a kebab-case version of your theme name: `grand-sunrise`.

### Create a style.css

Now you’ll need to create a file named `style.css`. It is the one absolutely necessary file for a child theme to exist. All `style.css` files must contain a File Header and the required header fields, as outlined in the [Main Stylesheet](#themes/core-concepts/main-stylesheet) documentation (please review this doc if you have not already done so).

As noted in the Main Stylesheet documentation, there is an additional field necessary to declare a theme as a child theme. You must add the `Template` header field to the `style.css` File Header:

```css
/**
 * Theme Name: Grand Sunrise
 * Template:   twentytwentyfour
 * ...other header fields
 */
```

There is one caveat to the `Template` field. It must be a 100% match of the folder name of the parent theme, relative to the `wp-content/themes` folder. In this case, we know that the Twenty Twenty-Four theme folder is located at `wp-content/themes/twentytwentyfour`. Therefore, the `Template` value must be `twentytwentyfour`.

### Install and activate child theme

If you are not already working within a development environment with your theme in the `wp-content/themes` folder, you’ll need to move it there now. Depending on your setup, you have several options, but the easiest is to create a ZIP file of your theme and upload it to your test site via **Appearance &gt; Themes &gt; Add New** in your WordPress admin.

For more information on how to add a theme to a WordPress, read [Adding New Themes](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/work-with-themes/#adding-new-themes) from the WordPress Documentation site.

Once your theme is installed, visit **Appearance &gt; Themes** in your WordPress admin and locate your theme. Click the **Activate** link as shown in this screenshot:

[![WordPress Appearance > Themes screen showing the popup overlay of an empty child theme.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/01/child-theme-activate.jpg?resize=2048%2C1055&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/01/child-theme-activate.jpg?ssl=1)It won’t look any different from your parent theme right now because you haven’t customized it yet. But you have successfully created a child theme.

## Customizing your child theme

When customizing your child theme, all the functionality documented throughout this handbook is fully available to you. But there are a few considerations you should keep in mind, which you’ll learn about in the following sections.

### Loading style.css

This is an optional step and often not needed for block themes because their style handling is generally done via [`theme.json`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles). But it is often necessary if you are building a classic theme. Regardless, you only need to perform this step if you want to ensure that any CSS code in `style.css` is loaded.

Before proceeding with this section, be sure to review the [Including Assets](#themes/core-concepts/including-assets) documentation, which covers how to load `style.css` in more detail. In that documentation, you will learn how to enqueue stylesheets via the [`wp_enqueue_style()`](#reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style) function on the appropriate hook (note that child themes are loaded before their parent themes).

The ideal method of enqueueing stylesheets is when a parent theme loads both its own `style.css` and the child theme’s `style.css`. But not all themes do this. Therefore, you must examine the code of the parent theme to see which stylesheets it is enqueueing. This is different for every theme, and there are no hard rules.

If the parent theme loads both stylesheets, the child theme does not need to do anything. Its stylesheet will be automatically loaded.

In the case of the Twenty Twenty-Four theme, it doesn’t load a stylesheet at all. So you would have to load your `style.css` via `functions.php` as shown in this code snippet:

```php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'grand_sunrise_enqueue_styles' );

function grand_sunrise_enqueue_styles() {
	wp_enqueue_style( 
		'grand-sunrise-style', 
		get_stylesheet_uri()
	);
}
```

If the parent theme you are using only loads its own stylesheet, you would also use the above code to load your child theme’s `style.css`.

If the parent theme loads only the active theme’s stylesheet, such as via `get_stylesheet_uri()`, then it will load the child theme’s stylesheet. In this case, you may want to also enqueue the parent theme’s stylesheet via `functions.php`, and your code would look like this:

```php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'grand_sunrise_enqueue_styles' );

function grand_sunrise_enqueue_styles() {
	wp_enqueue_style( 
		'grand-sunrise-parent-style', 
		get_parent_theme_file_uri( 'style.css' )
	);
}
```

### Templates, parts, and patterns

When building a child theme, you have the option to overwrite any template, part, or pattern that exists in the parent theme by adding a file of the same name in your child theme. *Note: patterns must also have the same registered `Slug` field.*

You can also add brand new templates, parts, and patterns to your child theme, even if they don’t exist in the parent. To learn more about these features, refer to these articles in the handbook:

- [Templates](#themes/templates)
- [Patterns](#themes/features/block-patterns)

### Using functions.php

Unlike templates and patterns, the `functions.php` file of a child theme does not override the `functions.php` file in the parent theme. In fact, they are both loaded, with the child being loaded immediately before the parent.

In that way, the `functions.php` of a child theme provides a smart, trouble-free method of modifying the functionality of a parent theme or WordPress.

Suppose that you wanted to add a PHP function to your theme. The fastest way would be to open its `functions.php` file and put the function there. But that’s not considered a good practice—**the next time your theme is updated, your function will disappear!**

It’s much better to create a child theme and add your custom code to your child theme’s `functions.php` file. The function will do the exact same job from there too, with the advantage that it will not be affected by future updates of the parent theme.

Do not copy code directly from the `functions.php` of a parent theme into your child theme. That will likely lead to fatal errors because of duplicate function names.

To learn more about `functions.php`, check out the [Custom Functionality](#themes/core-concepts/custom-functionality) documentation.

### Referencing or including other files

Sometimes you need to include or use custom files in your theme. When doing so, you need to make sure that you’re using the function that will give you the correct directory path or URI based on your child theme’s directory.

For example, if you wanted to include another PHP file via your `functions.php`, you would use the [`get_theme_file_path()`](#reference/functions/get_theme_file_path) function. Here is a code snippet that shows including a `functions-helpers.php` file from an `/inc` folder in your child theme:

```php
require_once get_theme_file_path( 'inc/functions-helpers.php' );
```

To learn more about including files, read the [Custom Functionality](#themes/core-concepts/custom-functionality) documentation.

When you need to reference a file by its URL, such as an image or stylesheet, you must use a different function: [`get_theme_file_uri()`](#reference/functions/get_theme_file_uri). Let’s look at an example of using a file named `bunny.jpg` from your theme’s `/assets/images` folder in an `<img>` HTML tag:

```php
<?php $image = get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/images/bunny.jpg' ); ?>

<img src="<?php echo esc_url( $image ); ?>" alt="" />
```

You can find out more about including scripts, styles, images, and other assets from the [Including Assets](#themes/core-concepts/including-assets) documentation.

### Internationalization

Like parent themes, child themes can also be internationalized and made to work in any language. To learn more, read the [Internationalization](#themes/advanced-topics/internationalization) documentation in the Theme Handbook.

The biggest changes, as noted in the Internationalization documentation, are that you must create a unique text domain and use [`load_child_theme_textdomain()`](#reference/functions/load_child_theme_textdomain) instead of [`load_theme_textdomain()`](#reference/functions/load_theme_textdomain) when manually loading translations.

# Theme Options &#8211; The Customize API <a name="themes/customize-api" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/customize-api/

The Customize API (Customizer) is a framework for live-previewing any change to WordPress. It provides a unified interface for users to customize various aspects of their theme and their site, from colors and layouts to widgets, menus, and more. Themes and plugins alike can add options to the Customizer. The Customizer is the canonical way to add options to your theme.

[![The customizer as it appears in WordPress 4.6 with the Twenty Fifteen theme.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/customize-4.6.png?resize=640%2C360&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/customize-4.6.png?ssl=1)The customizer as it appears in WordPress 4.6 with the Twenty Fifteen theme.

Customizer options can be granted to users with different capabilities on a granular basis, so while most options are visible only to administrators by default, other users may access certain options if you want them to be able to. Different parts of the Customizer can also be contextual to whether they’re relevant to the front-end context that the user is previewing. For example, the core widgets functionality only shows widget areas that are displayed on the current page; other widget areas are shown when the user navigates to a page that includes them within the Customizer preview window.

This section contains an overview of the Customize API, including code examples and discussion of best practices. For more details, it is strongly recommended that developers study the core customizer code (all core files containing “customize”). This is considered the canonical, official documentation for the Customize API outside of the inline documentation within the core code.

# UI Best Practices <a name="themes/advanced-topics/ui-best-practices" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/ui-best-practices/

## Logo Homepage Link

The logo at the top each page should send the user to the homepage of your site.  
If you are using the recommended function, [the\_custom\_logo()](#reference/functions/the_custom_logo) or the site logo block, the logo is linked to the homepage by default.

You can also add your logo manually. Assuming your logo is in your theme directory, this is how to display it in the `header.php` template file.

```php
<a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>"><img src="<?php echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri(); ?>/logo.png" alt="<?php esc_attr_e( 'Home Page', 'textdmomain' );?>" /></a>
```

## Descriptive Anchor Text

The anchor text is the visible text for a hyperlink. Good link text should give the reader an idea of the action that will take place when clicking it.

A bad example:

```
The best way to learn WordPress is to start using it. To Download WordPress, <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">click here</a>.

```

A better example:

```
<a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress</a> and start using it. That's the best way to learn.

```

## Style Links with Underlines

By default, browsers underline links to let the user know what is clickable. Some designers use CSS to turn off underlines for hyperlinks. This causes usability and accessibility problems, as it makes it more difficult to identify hyperlinks from the surrounding text.

## Different Link Colors

Color is another visual cue that text is clickable. Styling hyperlinks with a different color than the surrounding text makes them easier to distinguish.

Hyperlinks are one of the few HTML features that have state. The two most important states are *visited* and *unvisited*.

Having different colors for these two states helps users identify the pages they’ve visited before. A good trick for taking the guess work out of visited links is to color them 10%-20% darker than the unvisited links.

There are 3 other states that links can have:

- hover, when a mouse is over an element
- focus, similar to hover but for keyboard users
- active, when a user is clicking on a link

Since hover and focus have similar meanings, it is useful to give them the same styles.

Though hover and focus have similar meanings, they have different interaction patterns. If you choose a subtle hover state, you should have a more easily identifiable focus state. Hovering over a link is a directed activity, where the user knows where they are in the page and only needs to identify whether that spot is linked. Focus is an undirected activity, where the user needs to discover where their focus has moved to after shifting focus from the previous location.

## Color Contrast

Color contrast refers to the **difference between two colors**. Contrast is low between navy blue and black. Contrast is high between white and black. WebAIM, a non-profit web accessibility organization, provides a [color contrast calculator](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to help you determine the contrast in your website design. The WCAG 2.0 requires a ratio of 4.5:1 on normal text to be [AA compliant](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#qr-visual-audio-contrast-contrast).

## Sufficient Font Size

Make your text easy to read. By making your text large enough, you increase the usability of your site and make the content easier to understand. 14px is the smallest text should be.

## Associate Labels with Inputs

Labels inform the user what an input field is for. You can connect the label to the input by using the `for` attribute in the label. This will allow the user to click the label and focus on the input field.

```
<label for="username">Username</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="login" />
```

Labels work for radio buttons as well. Since it works using the **id** field *and not the name*, each input for the group gets its own label.

```
<input type="radio" id="user_group_blogger" name="user_group" value="blogger" />
<label for="user_group_blogger">Blogger</label>
 
<input type="radio"  id="user_group_designer" name="user_group" value="designer" />
<label for="user_group_designer">Designer</label>
 
<input type="radio"  id="user_group_developer" name="user_group" value="developer" />
<label for="user_group_developer">Developer</label>
```

## Placeholder Text in Forms

Placeholder text shows the user an example of what to type. When a user puts their cursor in the field, the placeholder text will disappear, while the label remains.

```
<label for="name">Name</label>
<input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="John Smith" />
```

Use placeholders to suggest the type of data a field requires, and not as a substitute for the field label.

## Descriptive Buttons

The web is filled with buttons that have unclear meanings. Remember the last time you used ‘OK’ or ‘submit’ on your login form? Choosing better words to display on your buttons can make your website easier to use. Try the pattern *\[verb\] \[noun\]* — Create user, Delete File, Update Password, Send Message. Each describes what will happen when the user clicks the button.

# JavaScript Best Practices <a name="themes/advanced-topics/javascript-best-practices" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/javascript-best-practices/

Many themes use JavaScript to provide interactivity, animation or other enhancements. These best practices will help ensure your code works efficiently and does not cause conflicts with your content or plugins.

## Use Included Libraries

There are many useful JavaScript libraries you may want to include when building your theme. Did you know that WordPress comes bundled with dozens of popular libraries? Check out this [list of default scripts included with WordPress](#themes/basics/including-css-javascript).

A common mistake made by beginning theme and plugin developers is to bundle their theme or plugin with their own version of the library. This may conflict with other plugins that enqueue the version bundled with WordPress. As a best practice, make your theme compatible with the version of your favorite library included with WordPress.

Do not try to use your own version of a JavaScript library that is already [bundled](#themes/basics/including-css-javascript "Default Scripts Included with WordPress") with WordPress. Doing so may break core functionality and conflict with plugins.

If you feel you MUST replace the WordPress version with one of your own… well… the answer is still: don’t do it. The versions of JavaScript libraries used by WordPress may include custom tweaks that WordPress needs to operate. Any time you override these libraries, you risk breaking your WordPress instance. Moreover, plugins created by other authors should be written to be compatible with WordPress’s version of these libraries as well. Adding your own version may (and often does!) conflict with plugins.

## Standard JavaScript

Javascript is growing in popularity for web developers, and it’s being used to accomplish for a variety of tasks. Here are some best practices to use when writing your JavaScript

- Avoid Global Variables
- Keep your JavaScript unobtrusive
- Use closures and the [module pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
- Stick to a coding style. Use The [WordPress Javascript Coding Standard](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/javascript/).
- Validate and Lint Your Code – [E](http://JSLint.com)[S](http://JSLint.com)[Lint.com](https://eslint.org/)
- Ensure your site still works without JavaScript first – then add JavaScript to provide additional capabilities. This is a form of [Progressive Enhancement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement).
- Lazy load assets that aren’t immediately required.
- Don’t use jQuery *if you don’t need to* — There’s a great site that shows you how to do some common tasks with plain old JavaScript – [you might not need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com)

## jQuery

### Including jQuery in your theme

[jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) is a popular JavaScript library to make working with JavaScript easier and more reliable across browsers. If you use jQuery, be sure to [follow the handbook guidelines on including JavaScript](#themes/basics/including-css-javascript). Giving your theme’s enqueued .js files a dependency array of `array( 'jquery' )` ensures that the jQuery script has been downloaded and loaded before your theme’s code.

#### Using $

Because the copy of jQuery included in WordPress loads in `<a href="https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/">noConflict()</a>` mode, use this wrapper code in your theme’s .js files to map “$” to “jQuery”:

```javascript
( function( $ ) {
// Your code goes here
} )( jQuery );
```

This wrapper (called an Immediately Invoked Function Expression, or IIFE) lets you pass in a variable—jQuery—on the bottom line, and give it the name “$” internally. Within this wrapper you may use `$` to select elements as normal.

### Selectors

Every time you select an element with jQuery, it performs a query through your document’s markup. These queries are very fast, but they do take time—you can make your site respond faster by re-using your jQuery objects instead of using a new query. So instead of repeating selectors:

```javascript
// Anti-pattern
$('.post img').addClass('theme-image');
$('.post img').on('click', function() { ... });
```

it is recommended to **cache your selectors** so you can re-use the returned element without having to repeat the lookup process:

```javascript
var $postImage = $('.post img');
// All image tags within posts can now be accessed through $postImage
$postImage.addClass('theme-image');
$postImage.on('click', function() { ... });
```

### Event Handling

When you use jQuery methods like `.bind` or `.click`, jQuery creates a new browser event object to handle processing the requested event. Each new event created takes a small amount of memory, but the amount of memory required goes up the more events you bind. If you have a page with a hundred anchor tags and wanted to fire a `logClick` event handler whenever a user clicked a link, it is very easy to write code like this:

```javascript
// Anti-pattern
$('a').click( logClick );
```

This works, but under the hood you have asked jQuery to create a new event handler for every link on your page.

**Event delegation** is a way to accomplish the same effect with less overhead. Because events in jQuery “bubble”—that is, a click event will fire on a link, then on the link’s surrounding `<p>` tag, then on the `div` container, and so on up to the `document` object itself—we can put a single event handler higher up in the page structure, and still catch the click events for all of those links:

```javascript
// Bind one handler at the document level, which is triggered
// whenever there is a "click" event originating from an "a" tag
$(document).on('click', 'a', logClick);
```

# Plugin API Hooks <a name="themes/advanced-topics/plugin-api-hooks" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/plugin-api-hooks/

A theme should work well with WordPress plugins. Plugins add functionality by using actions and filters, which are collectively called hooks (see [Plugin API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API "Plugin API") for more information).

Most hooks are executed internally by WordPress, so your theme does not need special tags for them to work. However, a few hooks need to be included in your theme templates. These hooks are fired by special Template Tags:

[wp\_head()](#reference/functions/wp_head "Function Reference/wp head")Goes at the end of the &lt;head&gt; element of a theme’s *header.php* template file.[wp\_body\_open()](#reference/functions/wp_body_open "Function Reference/wp head")Goes at the begining of the &lt;body&gt; element of a theme’s *header.php* template file.[wp\_footer()](#reference/functions/wp_footer "Function Reference/wp footer")Goes in *footer.php*, just before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag.[wp\_meta()](#reference/functions/wp_meta "Function Reference/wp meta")Typically goes in the &lt;li&gt;Meta&lt;/li&gt; section of a Theme’s menu or sidebar.[comment\_form()](#reference/functions/comment_form "Function Reference/comment form")Goes in *comments.php* directly before the file’s closing tag (&lt;/div&gt;).Take a look at a core theme’s templates for examples of how these hooks are used.

---

# Required Theme Files <a name="themes/releasing-your-theme/required-theme-files" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/releasing-your-theme/required-theme-files/

  
**Block theme:** See [Create a Block Theme](#block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/create-block-theme) for building a block theme  

Classic themes must include the required theme files. These files must follow template file standards set by the themes team. For Classic themes, additional standard template files are recommended to use. Learn more about the [Organizing Theme Files](#themes/basics/organizing-theme-files).

## Classic Themes Required Theme Files

1. **style.css** Your theme’s main [stylesheet](#themes/basics/including-css-javascript) file. This file will also include information about your theme, such as author name, version number, and plugin URL, in it’s header.
2. **index.php** The main [template](#themes/basics/template-files) file for your theme. This will be the template for the homepage on your site unless a static front page is specified. If you *only* include this template file, it must include all functionality of your theme. However, you can use as many relevant template files as you want in your theme.
3. ****comments.php**** The comment template which is included wherever comments are allowed. This file should provide support for threaded comments and trackbacks, and should style author comments differently then user comments. See the [Comments](#themes/functionality/comments) page for more information.
4. **screenshot** In the WordPress.org theme directory, the screenshot acts as a visual indicator of what your theme looks like. It is visible both in the web view and in the admin dashboard. The screenshot must not be bigger than 1200 x 900px.

While these files are the only files required by the theme review team for acceptance into the WordPress.org theme directory, you may use other template files. Of course, any file mentioned in the tutorial in this handbook may be used in your theme.

# Testing <a name="themes/releasing-your-theme/testing" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/releasing-your-theme/testing/

If you’ve followed this handbook, you’ll already have a good grasp on the testing required before submitting your theme to the WordPress.org theme directory. If you haven’t, this page will give you a quick refresher.

Testing is incredibly important before releasing a theme. You may have built the most beautiful WordPress theme, but if it breaks when someone tries to comment or insert an image, your theme isn’t ready for real world usage.

Before testing your theme, make sure you’ve setup a development environment. There are a number of ways to setup your environment, many of which are documented on the [Setting up a Development Environment](#themes/getting-started/setting-up-a-development-environment) page.

## Theme Unit Test

After you’ve setup your development environment, you’ll need test content to test your theme with. While you can create your own test content, the theme review team has created the [Theme Unit Test](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test), which includes many different types of content. This will help ensure that your theme works in circumstances you may not have anticipated.

The Theme Unit Test is a WordPress export file that can be imported into any WordPress installation by using the WordPress Importer. You should import it into your local development environment.

## WordPress Settings

Making tweaks and changes to your WordPress installation is another good way to ensure that you’ve built your theme to handle numerous scenarios. Use the following settings to test your theme.

**General**  
Set the Site Title to something long and set the Tagline to something even longer. These settings will test how your theme handles edge cases for site titles and taglines.

**Reading**  
Set “Blog pages show at most” to 5. This setting will ensure that index/archive pagination is triggered.

**Discussion**  
Enable “Threaded Comments” at least 3 levels deep. This setting will facilitate testing of your theme’s comment list styling.

Enable “Break comments into pages” and set 5 comments per page to test the pagination and styling of comments.

**Media**  
Remove the values for the large size of media to test the theme’s `$content_width` setting.

**Permalinks**  
Change the permalink setting a few times to ensure your theme can handle various URL formats.

For more setup instructions, take a look at the [Theme Unit Test](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test#Setup) page in the WordPress Codex.

## WordPress Beta Tester

WordPress releases happen three times a year. It’s a good idea to test your theme against the next version of WordPress so you can anticipate issues when the next version is released. This can be done easily with the [WordPress Beta Tester](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/) plugin. The plugin makes it easy to download either the latest nightly version of WordPress or the latest branch version (for minor bugfix releases). This is especially useful when anticipating a new major release or developing for an upcoming feature.

## Testing and debugging tools

### Theme Check

Each theme goes through an automated check before a reviewer even sees it. If there are any immediate problems with the theme, identified by the automated check, the theme will be rejected with notes on how to resolve the issues. The [Theme Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/) plugin adds a dashboard link under Appearance so you can run the exact same checks that WordPress.org does right from your administration panel. Doing this prior to uploading your theme lets you know what needs to be addressed prior to submission. Running the check will give you a list of any warnings your theme has generated and what items are required for the theme to be accepted in the WordPress.org theme directory, as well as any recommended items that may be missing from your theme.

### Developer

The [Developer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/developer/) plugin is really just a tool to automatically download and install some of the plugins you’ll want when developing your theme. Some of the ones discussed in this handbook will already be installed and active. Others you can install as soon as you activate the plugin.

### Debug Bar

[Debug Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/) pushes all debug messages to a separate page where they are listed in an easy-to-read layout and organized by type of message. There are also a number of [other plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=debug+bar) that add on to Debug Bar, extending its features or adding more information.

### Log Deprecated Notices

[Log Deprecated Notices](https://wordpress.org/plugins/log-deprecated-notices/) displays a list of the deprecated function notices in your theme and where the code can be found. This should be run, at minimum, after every major release of WordPress, so you can resolve and remove any deprecated code and functions from your theme.

### Browser testing

When submitting your theme to WordPress.org, it’s expected that it works well in modern browsers and at any resolution. You should test your theme against a number of popular browsers before submitting, both mobile and desktop. Many browsers have built-in features making it easy to test, for example the [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools), [Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools), and the [Microsoft Edge tools](http://dev.modern.ie). Note that [Internet Explorer is no longer supported by WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/04/22/ie-11-support-phase-out-plan/) since 5.8 release.

### Validation

Likewise, your theme should use valid HTML5 and CSS code. There are a variety of tools that will test your site for valid code, include [this HTML5 validator](http://html5.validator.nu/) and [this CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

# Theme Review Guidelines <a name="themes/releasing-your-theme/theme-review-guidelines" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/releasing-your-theme/theme-review-guidelines/

The [WordPress Themes Team](https://make.wordpress.org/themes "https://make.wordpress.org/themes") provides and maintains the theme review guidelines as part of their task as WordPress Contributors and Developers for the [WordPress Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/). Some of these guidelines are required before themes are included in the theme directory. Other guidelines are recommendations for best practices in developing your theme and making it available to as many people as possible. This handbook uses both recommendations and requirements from the theme review guidelines to ensure the theme you develop is accessible to everyone.

The requirements for being included in the WordPress.org theme directory can be found [here](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/).

## Get Involved

The WordPress Themes Team is [open to anyone](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/) and is a great way to get a better understanding of how themes are developed. To become a member of the WordPress Themes Team, read through the [WordPress Themes Team’s site](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/).

# Writing Documentation <a name="themes/releasing-your-theme/writing-documentation" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/releasing-your-theme/writing-documentation/

Documentation is important for themes as it provides a way for users to understand what a theme does and does not support. Likewise, documenting the code of your theme will make it easier for other theme developers to customize your theme, likely with a [child theme](#themes/advanced-topics/child-themes).

Here’s a list of **requirements** and **recommendations** for your theme’s documentation.

- Themes are **required** to provide end-user documentation of any design limitations or extraordinary installation/setup instructions.
- Themes are **required** to include a [readme.txt file](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/readme.txt), using the plugin directory’s readme.txt markdown format. New themes need to follow this rule as of October 25th, 2018. Old themes have a 6 months grace time from this date. Since WordPress 5.8 theme [readme files are not parsed for requirements](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/48520). This means that headers `Requires PHP` and `Requires at least` are going to be parsed from theme’s `style.css` file.

# Submitting Your Theme to WordPress.org <a name="themes/releasing-your-theme/submitting-your-theme-to-wordpress-org" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/releasing-your-theme/submitting-your-theme-to-wordpress-org/

Before themes are added to the WordPress Theme Directory, they are closely reviewed by the [Themes team](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/) to make sure they adhere to basic [guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/). This review ensures that WordPress users across the globe can download themes that are high quality and secure.

## Need Help?

If you have theme development questions, please post them in the [Developing with WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/forum/wp-advanced/) forum. Volunteers from around the world are ready to assist you with the development of your theme.

## Guidelines

Make sure you review the [Theme Review Guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/) before uploading a theme. If you have questions about these guidelines, you can ask them in the [\#themes](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/themes) channel in [Slack](https://chat.wordpress.org/). Anyone with a WordPress.org account can access the Making WordPress Slack.

## Testing With Sample Data

The [WordPress Themes Team](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/) will be reviewing your theme using the sample data from the [Theme Unit Test](#themes/release/testing). Before uploading your theme for review, please test it with this sample export data.

## Uploading Your Theme

When you are ready to submit your theme for review, please upload your theme ZIP at [Themes &gt; Upload](https://wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/). Future updates are to be uploaded via the same page.

# Template Files <a name="themes/basics/template-files" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/

Template files are used throughout WordPress themes, but first let’s learn about the terminology.

## Template Terminology

The term “template” is used in different ways when working with WordPress themes:

- Templates files exist within a theme and express how your site is displayed.
- [Template Hierarchy](#themes/basics/template-hierarchy) is the logic WordPress uses to decide which theme template file(s) to use, depending on the content being requested.
- [Page Templates](#themes/template-files-section/page-template-files "Page Templates") are those that apply to pages, posts, and custom post types to change their look and feel.

**In classic themes,** [Template Tags](#themes/basics/template-tags "Template Tags") are built-in WordPress functions you can use inside a template file to retrieve and display data (such as [`the_title()`](#reference/hooks/the_title "Function Reference/the title") and [`the_content()`](#reference/hooks/the_content "Function Reference/the content")).

**In block themes,** blocks are used instead of template tags.

## Template files

WordPress themes are made up of template files.

- In classic themes these are PHP files that contain a mixture of HTML, [Template Tags](#themes/basics/template-tags "Template Tags"), and PHP code.
- In block themes these are HTML files that contain HTML markup representing blocks.

When you are building your theme, you will use template files to affect the layout and design of different parts of your website. For example, you would use a `header` template or template part to create a header.

When someone visits a page on your website, WordPress loads a template based on the request. The type of content that is displayed by the template file is determined by the [Post Type](#themes/basics/post-types) associated with the template file. The [Template Hierarchy](#themes/basics/template-hierarchy "Template Hierarchy") describes which template file WordPress will load based on the type of request and whether the template exists in the theme. The server then parses the code in the template and returns HTML to the visitor.

The most critical template file is `the index`, which is the catch-all template if a more-specific template can not be found in the [template hierarchy](#themes/basics/template-hierarchy). Although a theme only needs a `index` template, typically themes include numerous templates to display different content types and contexts.

## Template partials

A template part is a piece of a template that is included as a part of another template, such as a site header. Template part can be embedded in multiple templates, simplifying theme creation. Common template parts include:

- `header.php` or `header.html` for generating the site’s header
- `footer.php` or `footer.html` for generating the footer
- `sidebar.php` or `sidebar.html` for generating the sidebar

While the above template files are special-case in WordPress and apply to just one portion of a page, you can create any number of template partials and include them in other template files.

In block themes, template parts must be placed inside a folder called parts.

## Common WordPress template files

Below is a list of some basic theme templates and files recognized by WordPress.

**index.php (classic theme) or index.html (block theme)**

The main template file. It is **required** in all themes.

**style.css**

The main stylesheet. It is **required** in all themes and contains the information header for your theme.

**rtl.css**

The right-to-left stylesheet is included automatically if the website language’s text direction is right-to-left.

**front-page.php (classic theme) or front-page.html (block theme)**

The front page template is always used as the site front page if it exists, regardless of what settings on **Admin &gt; Settings &gt; Reading**.

**home.php (classic theme) or home.html (block theme)**

The home page template is the front page by default. If you do not set WordPress to use a static front page, this template is used to show latest posts.

**singular.php (classic theme) or singular.html (block theme)**

The singular template is used for posts when `single.php` is not found, or for pages when `page.php` are not found. If `singular.php` is not found, `index.php` is used.

**single.php (classic theme) or single.html (block theme)**

The single post template is used when a visitor requests a single post.

**single-{post-type}.php (classic theme) or single-{post-type}.html (block theme)**

The single post template used when a visitor requests a single post from a custom post type. For example, `single-book.php` would be used for displaying single posts from a custom post type named *book*.

**archive-{post-type}.php (classic theme) or archive-{post-type}.html (block theme)**

The archive post type template is used when visitors request a custom post type archive. For example, `archive-books.php` would be used for displaying an archive of posts from the custom post type named *books*. The archive template file is used if the `archive-{post-type} template` is not present.

**page.php (classic theme) or page.html (block theme)**

The page template is used when visitors request individual pages, which are a built-in template.

**page-{slug}.php (classic theme) or page-{slug}.html (block theme)**

The page slug template is used when visitors request a specific page, for example one with the “about” slug (page-about.php).

**category.php (classic theme) or category.html (block theme)**

The category template is used when visitors request posts by category.

**tag.php (classic theme) or tag.html (block theme)**

The tag template is used when visitors request posts by tag.

**taxonomy.php (classic theme) or taxonomy.html (block theme)**

The taxonomy term template is used when a visitor requests a term in a custom taxonomy.

**author.php (classic theme) or author.html (block theme)**

The author page template is used whenever a visitor loads an author page.

**date.php (classic theme) or date.html (block theme)**

The date/time template is used when posts are requested by date or time. For example, the pages generated with these slugs:  
http://example.com/blog/2014/  
http://example.com/blog/2014/05/  
http://example.com/blog/2014/05/26/

**archive.php (classic theme) or archive.html (block theme)**

The archive template is used when visitors request posts by category, author, or date. **Note**: this template will be overridden if more specific templates are present like `category.php`, `author.php`, and `date.php`.

**search.php (classic theme) or search.html (block theme)**

The search results template is used to display a visitor’s search results.

**attachment.php (classic theme) or attachment.html (block theme)**

The attachment template is used when viewing a single attachment like an image, pdf, or other media file.

**image.php (classic theme) or image.html (block theme)**

The image attachment template is a more specific version of `attachment.php` and is used when viewing a single image attachment. If not present, WordPress will use `attachment.php` instead.

**404.php (classic theme) or 404.html (block theme)**

The 404 template is used when WordPress cannot find a post, page, or other content that matches the visitor’s request.

**comments.php**

The comments template in classic themes. In block themes, blocks are used instead.

## Using template files

### Classic themes

In classic themes, within WordPress templates, you can use [Template Tags](#themes/basics/template-tags "Template Tags") to display information dynamically, include other template files, or otherwise customize your site.

For example, in your `index.php` you can include other files in your final generated page:

- To include the header, use [get\_header()](#reference/functions/get_header "Function Reference/get header")
- To include the sidebar, use [get\_sidebar()](#reference/functions/get_sidebar "Function Reference/get sidebar")
- To include the footer, use [get\_footer()](#reference/functions/get_footer "Function Reference/get footer")
- To include the search form, use [get\_search\_form()](#reference/functions/get_search_form "Function Reference/get search form")
- To include custom theme files, use [get\_template\_part()](#reference/functions/get_template_part "Function Reference/get template part")

Here is an example of WordPress template tags to *include* specific templates into your page:

```php
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
<?php get_template_part( 'featured-content' ); ?>
<?php get_footer(); ?>
```

There’s an entire page on [Template Tags](#themes/basics/template-tags "Template Tags") that you can dive into to learn all about them.

Refer to the section [Linking Theme Files &amp; Directories](#themes/basics/linking-theme-files-directories "Linking Theme Files & Directories") for more information on linking component templates.

### Block themes

In block themes you use blocks instead of template tags. Block markup is the HTML code that WordPress uses to display the block. Template parts are blocks, and you add them to your template files the same way as you add blocks.

To include a header or footer template part, add the block markup for the template part. The `slug` is the name of the part. If the file you want to include is called `header.html`, then the slug is “header”:

```markup
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header"} /-->
(your page content)
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer"} /-->

```

To include the search form, use the block markup for the search block:

```markup
<!-- wp:search {"label":"Search","buttonText":"Search"} /-->
```

# Reworking Theme Files &amp; Organization <a name="themes/basics/reworking-theme-files-organization" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/reworking-theme-files-organization/

![basics-theme-files-organization-01](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/08/basics-theme-files-organization-01.jpg?resize=1024%2C384&ssl=1)

## Theme folder and file structure

While WordPress themes technically only require two files (`index.php` and `style.css`), they usually are made up of many files and can become quickly disorganized.

In the last section, [Template Files](# "Template Files"), you set up your `header.php, footer.php, page.php, home.php, and single.php` files.

Let’s look at the [Twenty Twelve theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwelve) default themes as one example of good file structure and organization. While this may be a bit overwhelming at first, let’s break it down. Can you find the templates you just built?

![basics-theme-files-organization-02](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/08/basics-theme-files-organization-02.png?resize=629%2C1500&ssl=1)

While there are still a lot of files, their names help provide a context of what they are. Basically each file handles a feature of WordPress. I.e. `comments.php` deals with how the theme will handle comments; `image.php` instructs the theme how to handle images, etc. Don’t worry about adding these files unless you need them.

You can see that the main theme template files are in the theme’s root directory, while JavaScript, languages, CSS, and page template files are placed within their own folders.

At this time there are **no required folders within a WordPress theme**. However, WordPress does recognize the following folders by default:

### Page templates folder

![basics-theme-files-organization-03](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/08/basics-theme-files-organization-03.png?resize=400%2C124&ssl=1)

The [custom page templates](#themes/basics/page-templates "Custom Page Templates"), named *page-templates* (since: 3.4.0) allows for better organization of template files. Custom page template files placed in this folder are automatically recognized by WordPress.

### Language folder

![basics-theme-files-organization-04](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/08/basics-theme-files-organization-04.png?resize=400%2C85&ssl=1)

If you wish to [internationalize your theme](#themes/functionality/internationalization "Internationalization") so it’s usable in other languages, you can create a *languages* folder to contain translations.

# Updating Your Theme <a name="themes/releasing-your-theme/updating-your-theme" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/releasing-your-theme/updating-your-theme/

There are two ways to update your theme, by uploading a Zip file or using subversion (SVN).

## Uploading a Zip file

While your theme is in the queue and waiting for review, you can update your theme by [uploading a Zip file](https://wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/). Just as you initially uploaded. Be sure to update the version number on style.css before uploading.

Updating the version number will NOT change the queue position of your theme while waiting for the review.

If you already have your themes in the repository, you can either update by uploading a Zip file or via SVN.

## Subversion GUI clients

Several GUI clients are available for Windows users. [TortoiseSVN](https://tortoisesvn.net/) is one of the popular Free clients. [SmartSVN](https://www.smartsvn.com/) is a paid application that works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

For Mac users, SVN helps streamline the automation process, including removing `<em>.DS_Store</em>` and `<em>__MACOSX</em>` hidden files and folders that often trigger the theme check errors.

### Important notes:

**(1) Directory naming guidelines**

The theme author must create a new directory before uploading the theme. It is important to name the new directory with the new version number. For example, if the current theme is version `<em>1.0.1</em>`, the name for the new directory must be *`1.0.2`*.

**(2) Version numbering**

Version numbering must follow a standard version naming convention. New version must be higher than the current version. For example, if your current theme is `<em>1.2.3</em>`, the new version must be `<em>1.2.4</em>`.

**(3) SVN is not a development tool**

Unlike Github, SVN is not a development tool. You should upload your theme only when you are ready to release a new version. Once you commit, the changes cannot be overwritten. If you find a mistake, even a small typo, there is no way to make changes. The only way to make corrections is to create another directory with a newer version number and upload it again.

### Uploading your themes using SVN on MacOS

**What you will need**

- MacOS
- VS code
- SVN extension for VS code

To check whether you have svn installed, type `svn --version` in the terminal.

(1) Create a copy of the repository on your local machine. Replace */NameOfYourTheme/* with your theme name. `<em>svn co https://themes.svn.wordpress.org/NameOfYourTheme/</em>`

For example, if your theme name is Hello World,   
use `<em>svn co https://themes.svn.wordpress.org/hello-world/</em>`

**Tips:** If you are not sure about the exact name of your theme (e.g. hyphen, underscore), you can find it at [this link](https://themes.svn.wordpress.org/).

(2) The next step is to create a new directory and copy all theme files, including the history from the current version of the theme. In the example below, we are creating a new directory 1.0.2, and copying all files from the version 1.0.1. `<em>svn cp 1.0.1 1.0.2</em>`

(3) Make changes to your theme.

**Note:** Make sure to update the version number on style.css, and the changelog on readme.txt

(4) Remove *.DS\_Store* hidden file. `<em>find . -name ".DS_Store" -print -delete</em>`

(5) Next, remove `<em>__MACOSX</em>` folder. `<em>rm -R __MACOSX</em>`

(6) Finally, you are ready to commit.

`<em>svn commit -m “Fix typo on readme.txt”</em>`

**Note:** Once you commit, there is no way to change or modify what you just committed. If you find a mistake, Repeat the process from step 2.

### What to expect next

Once you successfully upload the new update, you will receive a confirmation email from WordPress.org. It may take some time to reflect on the WordPress.org directory.

Block themes support accessibility and simplify the process for adding accessibility.

## Landmark

Group, Template part, and Query blocks can become a landmark. There are two ways to create landmark.

**Using block markup**  
`”tagName":"header”` creates header landmark.

```
<!-- wp:group {"tagName":"header","layout":{"type":"constrained"}} -->
<header class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:site-title /--></header>
<!-- /wp:group -->
```

**Using site editor**  
HTML element under Advanced section in the Block panel provides the following landmark options.

HTML element under Advanced section in the Block panel provides the following landmark options.  
`<header>` `<main>` `<section>` `<article>` `<aside>` `<footer>`.

## Skip to content

By selecting `<main>` landmark on Group, Template part, or Query block generates the Skip to Content link. Learn more about the [skip to content link here](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/#3-accessibility).

```
<!-- wp:group {"tagName":"main","layout":{"type":"constrained"}} -->
<main class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="hello-world">Hello World</h2>
<p>Welcome to WordPress. This is your first post. </p>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
```

## Accessible navigation menu

Navigation block enables the following accessibility without additional code.

- Support responsive view
- Support keyboard navigation
- Insert `<nav>` landmark role
- Insert ARIA attributes `aria-label` `aria-hidden`

Whether you’re building your very first theme or your tenth, the following resources are meant to help ease the process. Keep in mind that there are various community tools not mentioned here as well but that still might aid in your efforts.

## Block themes

A block theme is a type of WordPress theme built using blocks. You can read more about these themes in the [Block Theme section](#themes/block-themes).

[**Create Block Theme plugin**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/)

This plugin was created by various community members. This tool can create standalone block themes and child themes, depending on your needs. Here are the high-level steps:

1. Install and activate the [Create Block Theme](https://github.com/WordPress/create-block-theme) plugin. You will also need to be running the latest version of the [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) plugin.
2. Make changes to your site design using the Customizer and Site Editor.
3. Edit your templates using the Site Editor. For some things, you might need to edit the template files again later.
4. In the WordPress Admin Dashboard, under Appearance there will be a new page called “Create Block Theme”. You can add the details for the theme here. These details will be used in the style.css file.
5. Click the “Create Block Theme” button. From there, a zip file will be downloaded which will contain all the files for your theme.

[**Theme Generator**](https://fullsiteediting.com/block-theme-generator/)

This tool was created by Carolina Nymark and it allows you to create three different types of themes to start from:

- No Code: for non-developers who want to start from a blank theme and build directly in the Site Editor.
- Empty: for developers to make their own with six templates and a theme.json with empty settings for you to complete.
- Basic: for developers to explore with six templates, two template parts, three block patterns, and two custom block styles alongside some initial theme.json settings.
- Advanced: for developers to explore with seven templates, five template parts, seven patterns, various block styles, and a more robust theme.json. It’s common to want to remove some of the examples.

**Comparison Chart**

| **Tool** | **Child theme options?** | **Template creation?** | **Theme.json Controls** | **Demo content** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Create Block Theme plugin | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Theme Generator | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Classic themes

A classic theme is built with PHP templates, functions.php, and more. You can read more about these themes in the [Classic Theme section](#themes/classic-themes).

The [\_s (Underscores)](https://underscores.me/) starter theme is a tool for initializing and creating a classic theme.

# Theme security issues <a name="themes/theme-security/theme-security-issues" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/theme-security/theme-security-issues/

Please do not report security issues with WordPress Core to the themes team. To report an issue with WordPress itself, [follow the directions for reporting security vulnerabilities.](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/)

If you have found a **plugin** with a security issue, please read [Reporting Plugin Security Issues](#plugins/wordpress-org/plugin-security/reporting-plugin-security-issues)

## How to report a theme

If you find a theme with a security issue, please **do not** post about it publicly anywhere. Even if there’s a report filed on one of the official security tracking sites, bringing more awareness to the security issue tends to increase people being hacked, and rarely speeds up the fixing.

To report a theme that is in the WordPress.org theme directory, please go to the theme’s directory listing (For example, <https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/>) and use the “**Report this theme**” button in the sidebar, and complete the form.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/themes/files/2023/09/report_theme.jpg?ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/themes/files/2023/09/report_theme.jpg?ssl=1)  
  
You can also send reports of security issues to `themes@wordpress.org`. Include the following:

- a clear and concise description of the issue
- a link to the specific theme
- whether or not you have validated the security issue yourself
- **optional** – links to any public disclosures on 3rd party sites

## For developers

### What to do when you receive a request to update your theme

If your theme has been reported and the Themes Team decides that action needs to be taken, you will receive an email from the Themes Team with information and instructions.  
– You may be asked to solve an issue within a specific time frame. This depends on the severity of the issue.  
– The Themes Team may need to suspend your theme to prevent new downloads until the issue is resolved.  
 **You must reply to the email if you have any questions, need more information, or need more time.**

Test your theme update carefully and submit it through the [upload form on the theme directory page](https://wordpress.org/themes/upload/).

# Global Settings and Styles (theme.json) <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/

Welcome to the Global Settings and Styles documentation. In this chapter you will learn everything you need to know about configuring settings, styles, and more via your theme’s `theme.json` file.

`theme.json` is a foundational piece of block theming. While it is not a strictly required file, you will need to work with it for nearly any theme project. It is useful for everything from configuring colors to defining default typography settings to applying front-end styles to your theme.

## Navigating this chapter

Use the below links to find the topic you are looking for in this chapter. Each section of the chapter is set up to offer a straightforward learning path toward learning the ins-and-outs of `theme.json` for first-time themers. But if you are already familiar with the foundational concepts, feel free to skip ahead to the topic you want to learn more about.

- [**Introduction to `theme.json`**](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/introduction-to-theme-json)**:** A walkthrough of setting up your `theme.json` file, introducing you to the foundational concepts for configuring global settings and styles for your theme.
- [**Settings**](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings)**:** Documentation for each of the standard and custom settings that you can configure via `theme.json`. Sub-pages document every available setting.
- [**Styles**](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles)**:** Learn how to use the standard design system to apply styles through `theme.json`, which also integrate with the user interface.
- [**Custom Templates**](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/custom-templates)**:** How to register custom post, page, and CPT (custom post type) templates for your theme.

# Introduction to theme.json <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/introduction-to-theme-json" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/introduction-to-theme-json/

`theme.json` is a configuration file that lets you define the global settings, styles, and more for your theme. The file works with both block and classic themes.

When building a block theme, `theme.json` may be the most important file in the entire theme. In a way, it is the foundational piece that trickles down to every other component. That’s why this chapter is one of the most extensive in the handbook.

Some of the things you can do with `theme.json` include (but are not limited to):

- Enabling block features in the user interface, such as color, typography, and spacing controls.
- Configuring a custom color palette, duotone filters, and background gradients.
- Defining typographical features like font families, bundling web fonts, and more.
- Adding your own CSS custom properties.
- Adjusting the overall design by working within the core styles system.

The settings and styles that you configure in `theme.json` are ultimately reflected on both the front end of the site and WordPress’ built-in editors. As shown in this screenshot, you can see that a variation of the default Twenty Twenty-Three theme as it’s looks in the **Appearance &gt; Editor** screen in the admin:

[![WordPress Site Editor with the Styles panel open in the right sidebar.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/intro-styles-interface.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/intro-styles-interface.jpg?ssl=1)Each part of that design is handled directly in `theme.json`, and the user can further customize it through the built-in **Styles** interface.

`theme.json` represents what you might call a “common language” that allows WordPress, your theme, plugins, and users to effectively communicate. Because it is built atop a standardized system, each component plays a role in bringing the overall site to life.

## theme.json structure

The `theme.json` file can be broken down into several top-level sections as shown in this code snippet:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json",
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {},
	"styles": {},
	"customTemplates": {},
	"templateParts": {},
	"patterns": []
}
```

Throughout this chapter, you will learn about each of these properties and how you can work with them to turn the design in your imagination into a working theme.

Customizing the `theme.json` file directly in your theme requires that you have some familiarity with JSON code. You don’t need to be an expert (*copying and pasting can get you pretty far*), but having some foundational knowledge of how to format JSON will definitely help.

You should also have a baseline understanding of CSS. While you do not need to directly write CSS code in `theme.json`, many of the features are mapped to CSS properties and values. Understanding the relationship between `theme.json` settings and styles and their CSS counterparts will help you in the long run.

For more information on JSON and CSS, read:

- [MDN Web Docs: CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [MDN Web Docs: JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON)

## theme.json properties

As you could see in the previous section, the `theme.json` file has several top-level properties. Some of these accept just a single value, but most have nested sub-properties with their own values.

These are the current top-level properties that you can set in `theme.json`:

- **`version`:** The `theme.json` schema version you are building for.
- **`$schema`:** Used for defining the supported JSON schema, which will integrate with many code editors to give you on-the-fly hints and error reporting.
- **`settings`:** Used to define which block controls appear, configure presets, and more.
- **`styles`:** Used to apply colors, font sizes, custom CSS, and other styles to the website and blocks.
- **`customTemplates`:** Metadata for custom templates defined in your theme’s `/templates` folder.
- **`templateParts`:** Metadata for template parts defined in your theme’s `/parts` folder.
- **`patterns`:** An array of pattern slugs to be registered from the [Pattern Directory](https://wordpress.org/patterns/).

### Adding a version

At the very least, you should set the `version` property in your `theme.json` file. This should be an integer that matches the API version used to read and understand your `theme.json` code.

The API is currently at version `2`. You can always find the most up-to-date version via the [`theme.json` Living Reference](#block-editor/reference-guides/theme-json-reference/theme-json-living) document.

The bear minimum code that your `theme.json` file should have is:

```json
{
	"version": 2
}
```

All `theme.json` code examples in this handbook include the `version` property because it should always be set.

Technically, you can leave the version out, but WordPress will read your code as if it was on version `1` of the API. Using an outdated version may mean that your code will not be valid, at least as it is documented here in the handbook.

 You should always strive to keep up to date with the latest API version and make sure it is set in your `theme.json` file.

### Adding a JSON schema

An optional property that you can add to your `theme.json` is a URL to the JSON schema. This can be particularly helpful when working with any modern code editor. Adding the `$schema` property will give you on-the-fly hints and error reporting in many code editors and is highly recommended.

To add support for JSON schema, add this to your `theme.json` file:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json",
	"version": 2
}
```

Again, this is *technically* an optional property. But there is rarely a good reason to leave it out. It’s just good development practice to include it.

### Adding settings, styles, and more

The other properties available to you via `theme.json` require more in-depth documentation than what can be covered in this introduction. They each have their own pages (and some with multiple sub-pages) in this chapter of the handbook.

Now it’s time to really dive into learning more about `theme.json`. You can take these next documentation steps as you prefer, but these are listed in their recommended reading order:

- [**Settings**](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings)**:** Documentation for each of the standard and custom settings that you can configure via `theme.json`.

# Settings <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/

The `settings` property in `theme.json` lets you configure a wide range of settings for a WordPress install. It covers everything from color presets, to enabling typography design tools, to layout, and a little bit of everything in between.

This document contains links for learning about each of these settings, which have their own individual documentation pages.

## The settings property

`settings` is a top-level property in `theme.json` and has multiple nested properties that you can define. And some of those nested properties have multiple levels of nesting of their own.

The following is an overarching look at these properties in the context of a `theme.json` file:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"appearanceTools": false,
		"border": {},
		"color": {},
		"custom": {},
		"dimensions": {},
		"layout": {},
		"position": {},
		"shadow": {},
		"spacing": {},
		"typography": {},
		"useRootPaddingAwareAlignments": false,
		"blocks": {}
	}
}
```

## Settings documentation

Use the following links to explore specific settings that you can configure in your `theme.json` file:

- **[`appearanceTools`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/appearance-tools):** A catchall setting for enabling multiple other settings.
- **`<a href="#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/border">border</a>`:** Used for controlling the border width, style, color, and radius.
- **[`color`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/color):** Lets you register a color palette, gradients, duotone and configure color-related settings.
- [`<strong>custom</strong>`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/custom): An object for adding custom settings, which are output as CSS custom properties.
- **[`dimensions`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/dimensions):** Lets you configure the minimum height setting.
- **[`layout`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/layout):** Used for setting layout properties like the content and wide widths.
- **[`lightbox`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/lightbox):** Lets you configure the image lightbox feature.
- **[`position`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/position):** Currently lets you define support for sticky positioning.
- **[`shadow`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/shadow):** Lets you configure box-shadow support and define custom shadow presets.
- **[`spacing`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/spacing):** Used for configuring spacing-related settings, such as margin and padding,
- **[`typography`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/typography):** Used for configuring typography-related settings, defining custom font sizes, and registering font families.
- **[`useRootPaddingAwareAlignments`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/use-root-padding-aware-alignments):** A boolean setting for how padding on the root element should work.
- **[`blocks`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/blocks):** An object for configuring per-block settings.

The Theme Handbook also maintains a [reference for available settings](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/settings-reference) based on the `theme.json` schema.

# Styles <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles/

The `styles` property in `theme.json` lets you configure settings at the global level, for individual elements, and individual blocks. WordPress supports a standard subset of the CSS specification, but also allows you to add custom CSS directly in your `theme.json` file.

When possible, it is recommended to add your theme styles via the `styles` property, at least for standard WordPress features. This makes it possible for users to customize them via **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Styles** without CSS specificity issues.

This document contains links for learning about the available style properties and how to apply styles to your theme via its `theme.json` file.

## The styles property

`styles` is a top-level property in `theme.json` and has multiple nested properties that you can define. And some of those nested properties have multiple levels of nesting of their own.

The following is an overarching look at these properties in the context of a `theme.json` file:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"styles": {
		"elements": {},
		"blocks": {}
	}
}
```

The following is an example of what the `styles` property could look like in a custom `theme.json` file. This should give you a feel for how it is structured, but you will dive into this more deeply as you read through this section of the handbook:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"styles": {
		"color": {
			"text": "#000000",
			"background": "#ffffff"
		},
		"elements": {
			"button": {
				"color": {
					"text": "#ffffff",
					"background": "#000000"
				}
			}
		},
		"blocks": {
			"core/code": {
				"color": {
					"text": "#ffffff",
					"background": "#000000"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

# Custom Templates <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/custom-templates" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/custom-templates/

WordPress lets you register custom templates in `theme.json`. More specifically, you can register single post, page, or CPT (custom post type) templates via the `customTemplates` property.

It’s important to make the distinction that these templates are meant for single post/page/CPT templates and not for other types of templates. When registering these templates, your theme users can select them from the edit post screen, and their post’s design will match the template on the front end of the site.

Custom templates give you a lot of flexibility in designing variations on your default post or page templates. For example, you could create a blank post template that only shows the content, design a page template with a sidebar, or even one that has no sidebars at all. Really, it depends on what your goals are for your theme project.

This documentation is to teach you how to register custom templates via `theme.json`. For a more extensive look into how to build custom templates, check out the [Templates documentation](#themes/templates).

## Adding custom templates

You can register custom templates via the `customTemplates` property in `theme.json`. It accepts an array of template objects, each defining an individual template.

Each object passed to the `customTemplates` array supports these properties:

- **`name`:** The name of your template file without the file extension.
- **`title`:** A human-readable title for your template, which may be translated.
- **`postTypes`:** An array of post type slugs that the template is usable on. This is an optional setting and defaults to the `page` post type.

For block themes, WordPress will look for custom templates (all templates, actually) in the theme’s `/templates` folder. Therefore, if you register a template with the name of `example`, you must also have an `/templates/example.html` file in your theme.

You can add as many custom templates as you want to your theme. Just keep in mind the usability aspect of offering too many choices.

### Registering a template

Suppose you wanted to create a template named Content Canvas for both pages and posts. This template will only show the site header, post/page content, and site footer. Your users can select it when they need the full content area to behave as a sort of blank canvas.

The first step you’d take is to create a `/templates/content-canvas.html` file in your theme. Don’t worry about adding anything to it yet; just leave it empty for the moment.

Now register this template in `theme.json`, as shown below:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"customTemplates": [
		{
			"name": "content-canvas",
			"title": "Content Canvas",
			"postTypes": [
				"page",
				"post"
			]
		}
	]
}
```

If you edit a post or page in the WordPress admin, you should see the new **Content Canvas** option under the **Template** selector in the **Post/Page** sidebar panel:

[![WordPress post editor with the Template select control highlighted in the right sidebar.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/custom-templates-canvas-select.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/custom-templates-canvas-select.jpg?ssl=1)### Building a template

Now let’s take care of actually building the template, at least for the sake of demonstration. Remember, you can learn more about building templates in the [Templates chapter](#themes/templates) of the handbook.

Add this code to your `/templates/content-canvas.html` file:

```markup
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header","tagName":"header"} /-->

<!-- wp:group {"tagName":"main","layout":{"type":"default"}} -->
<main class="wp-block-group">
	<!-- wp:post-content {"layout":{"type":"constrained"}} /-->
</main>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer","tagName":"footer"} /-->
```

This will give you a working template with an open content area.

To see what this looks like in the site editor, head over to **Appearance &gt; Editor** in the WordPress admin. Then, select **Content Canvas** under the **Templates** section:

[![WordPress Site Editor showing the Content Canvas template on the screen.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/custom-templates-canvas-site-editor.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/custom-templates-canvas-site-editor.jpg?ssl=1)This is just a demonstration of what is possible. The real power of custom templates is in what you build with them.

# Patterns <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/patterns" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/patterns/

The `patterns` property in `theme.json` lets you bundle patterns from the WordPress [Pattern Directory](https://wordpress.org/patterns/) with your theme. This is a neat system that lets you provide a wide variety of patterns that you’ve personally selected without having to design and build them yourself. Any pattern in the directory is available to you.

[![Screenshot of the WordPress.org Pattern Directory, which displays a grid of block pattern demos.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/patterns-directory.jpg?resize=2048%2C1458&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/patterns-directory.jpg?ssl=1)And if you’re feeling adventurous, you can even submit your custom-designed patterns to the directory. This will let you both bundle them with your theme and let other theme creators and users use your patterns, even when your theme is not installed.

In this document, you will learn how to include directory patterns for your theme’s users with just a few lines of code in `theme.json`.

## Adding patterns from the directory

`patterns` is an optional property that lets you bundle as many or as few patterns as you’d like with your theme. The property accepts an array of pattern slugs, and as long as those patterns exist in the Patterns Directory, they will appear in the **Patterns** inserter in the WordPress editors.

Here is a look at the `patterns` property in the default `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"patterns": []
}
```

Let’s take a look at one of the patterns from the Pattern Directory: [Hero banner with overlap images](https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/hero-banner-with-overlap-images/). To find the slug for the pattern, you need to look in the address bar of your browser, which should give you this URL:

```markup
https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/hero-banner-with-overlap-images/
```

The slug is the part of the URL that comes after `https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/`. In this case, the slug is `hero-banner-with-overlap-images` (note that the final slash is not included).

To include this pattern with your theme, you need to pass only the slug to the `patterns` array in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"patterns": [
		"hero-banner-with-overlap-images"
	]
}
```

Now that you’ve got the basics down, pick out a couple of other patterns and add them to your `patterns` array in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"patterns": [
		"fullscreen-cover-image-gallery",
		"hero-banner-with-overlap-images",
		"mixed-shape-gallery"
	]
}
```

Now you should see your chosen patterns in the **Patterns** inserter in the UI:

[![Patterns inserter from the page-editing screen showing a list of Gallery-based patterns.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/patterns-dotorg.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/patterns-dotorg.jpg?ssl=1)The patterns you include will automatically appear under the categories they are assigned to in the Pattern Directory. These are mapped to the existing patterns registered within WordPress. The patterns from the above example code all have the `gallery` pattern category, so they appear under the **Patterns &gt; Gallery** tab in the inserter.

# Template Parts <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/template-parts" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/template-parts/

Template parts are small sections (i.e., *parts*) that you can include in top-level templates. Following the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle, they are generally used as sections that need to be reused across multiple templates. Instead of writing the code multiple times, you can break it apart into a single file and include it when needed.

Because this chapter is focused on `theme.json`, the goal of this document is to explain how to register template parts within the `theme.json` file. You can dive more deeply into templates and template parts within the [Templates chapter](#themes/templates).

In `theme.json`, you can register additional metadata for template parts, such as the title and area the part is assigned to.

## Registering template parts

Technically, you can use custom template parts without ever registering them via `theme.json`. But registering them has some distinct advantages:

- You can give the part a translatable title that is more appealing in the user interface.
- You can assign each part to an area, creating a nicer user experience in the Site Editor.
- It plays more nicely with plugins, style variations, and child themes that may grab, filter, or otherwise use the registered metadata in some way.

To register template parts, you must pass an array of objects to the `templateParts` property in `theme.json`. Each object in the array accepts three key/value pairs:

- **`area`:** The area that the template part belongs to. The default options are `header`, `footer`, and `uncategorized`. You can also assign it to any custom area.
- **`name`:** The filename of your template part without the extension.
- **`title`:** A human-readable title for your template, which may be translated.

WordPress will look for template parts in the theme’s `/parts` folder. Therefore, if you register a template part with the name of `example`, you must also have a `/parts/example.html` file in your theme.

You will learn more about template part areas in the Templates chapter. Also, check out the [Upgrading the site-editing experience with custom template part areas](#news/2023/06/upgrading-the-site-editing-experience-with-custom-template-part-areas) tutorial on the WordPress Developer Blog for an in-depth walkthrough of creating custom areas.

### Registering a template part

The two most common template parts that any theme will register are for a site header and footer. This is also why WordPress has the default areas of `header` and `footer`. You are not required to use these parts or areas, but they are pretty much standard sections for nearly all websites.

For this exercise, let’s register them both. First, add a couple of empty files named `header.html` and `footer.html` in your theme’s `/parts` folder if they do not already exist. You’ll add some block code to them in the next step.

Now register those template parts in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"templateParts": [
		{
			"area": "header",
			"name": "header",
			"title": "Header"
		},
		{
			"area": "footer",
			"name": "footer",
			"title": "Footer"
		}
	]
}
```

It can be confusing when both the `area` and `name` values match. That’s not always the case, but is often how things look when dealing with the header and footer.

Some theme authors prefer to name the `header` and `footer` template parts `site-header` and `site-footer` to better differentiate them. Feel free to do that if it makes more sense to you. Or rename them to anything you want.

You are not limited to these two common template parts. You can add as many parts as you need for your theme project.

### Building a template part

All template parts should be placed in your theme’s `/parts` folder (WordPress also recognizes the `/template-parts` folder for backwards compatibility). So you will now be editing the `/parts/header.html` and `/parts/footer.html` files.

You will learn more about building custom template parts in the [Templates chapter](#themes/templates). For the purposes of this documentation, just consider the following code snippets as examples that you can customize.

In your `/parts/header.html` file, add this code:

```markup
<!-- wp:group {"style":{"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"2rem","bottom":"2rem","right":"2rem","left":"2rem"}}},"layout":{"type":"default"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group" style="padding-top:2rem;padding-right:2rem;padding-bottom:2rem;padding-left:2rem">
	<!-- wp:group {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"space-between"}} -->
	<div class="wp-block-group">
		<!-- wp:site-title /-->
		<!-- wp:navigation {"icon":"menu","layout":{"type":"flex","setCascadingProperties":true,"justifyContent":"right"}} /-->
	</div>
	<!-- /wp:group -->
</div>
<!-- /wp:group -->
```

Then add this code to your `/parts/footer.html` file:

```markup
<!-- wp:group {"style":{"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"2rem","right":"2rem","bottom":"2rem","left":"2rem"}}}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group" style="padding-top:2rem;padding-right:2rem;padding-bottom:2rem;padding-left:2rem">

	<!-- wp:group {"align":"wide","style":{"spacing":{"blockGap":"0"}},"layout":{"type":"flex","orientation":"vertical","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
	<div class="wp-block-group alignwide">
		<!-- wp:site-title {"level":0,"isLink":false,"className":"is-style-normalize"} /-->

		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
			<p>Powered by WordPress.</p>
		<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
	</div>
	<!-- /wp:group -->

</div>
<!-- /wp:group -->
```

Now go to **Appearance &gt; Editor** in your WordPress admin and look at the **Patterns &gt; Template Parts** section. You should see both the **Header** and **Footer** areas listed with your custom template parts:

[![Templates screen in the WordPress Site Editor. The Header area is specifically selected, showing a single Header template part.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/template-parts-site-editor.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/template-parts-site-editor.jpg?ssl=1)### Including a template part

Creating template part files and registering them in `theme.json` does not mean that your parts will automatically appear on the site. Because they are only *parts*, you must also include them inside of a template.

Remember, you’ll learn more about creating templates in the [Templates documentation](#themes/templates) if you are not already familiar with them. For now, you just need to test how the registration process works.

To include a template part in a top-level template, you must use the Template Part block. The basic markup for this block is:

```markup
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"your-part-slug"} /-->
```

So open one of the template files from your theme’s `/templates` folder. Your theme should at least have an `index.html` template there, but you can test with any file.

Now add the calls to the `wp:template-part` block as shown here:

```markup
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header","tagName":"header"} /-->

<!-- Other block markup goes here. -->

<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer","tagName":"footer"} /-->
```

Now you should be able to see both the Header and Footer template parts if you open the top-level template you added them to via **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Templates** in your WordPress admin:

[![WordPress Site Editor with a template being edited. The Header template part is selected.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/template-parts-include.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/template-parts-include.jpg?ssl=1)

# Style Variations <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/style-variations" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/style-variations/

Unlike most things here in the Global Settings and Styles documentation, style variations are not things you define within `theme.json`. Instead, they are “variations” to your existing `theme.json` file that you can offer to users.

A more accurate name for this feature might be *Global Settings and Styles Variations*. Or simply `theme.json` variations.

## What are style variations?

Style variations are essentially alternative versions of `theme.json` that you can ship with your theme. They are custom-named JSON files that are stored in your theme’s `/styles` folder. Any [setting](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings) or [style](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles) that you can add to `theme.json` can also be added to your style variation JSON file.

This lets your users pick and choose which variation they want to use on their site. In a way, they are “skins” for your theme.

For example, suppose you’ve created a restaurant theme and have kept the colors and typography pretty basic so that it covers a lot of different restaurant site designs. Further suppose that you wanted to offer more variety, variations on that initial design. You could create a style variation that caters more toward seafood restaurants with fun fonts and an ocean-oriented color palette. Or maybe you want to set the mood for coffee shops that might be running your theme.

That’s where style variations can really shine. You can bundle each of these alternative designs for your theme and let your users decide which is the best option for their site.

Here is a look at the style variations that are bundled with the default Twenty Twenty-Three theme:

[![WordPress Site Editor > Styles sub-screen, which is showing a grid of style variations with a red one in the preview panel.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/tt3-style-variations.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/09/tt3-style-variations.jpg?ssl=1)When a user selects a style variation, the JSON data is migrated to the site’s database and stored as a user customization. This allows the data to overrule the theme’s primary `theme.json` settings and styles.

## Adding custom style variations

The style variations feature is relatively straightforward if you already understand how `theme.json` works, but there are a couple of differences.

The first difference between `theme.json` and style variations are their names and placement in your theme’s folder structure. `theme.json` lives in the root of your theme folder and is considered the default variation. But custom variations must have a unique filename and be placed in the `/styles` folder.

Let’s assume you’ve built that restaurant theme mentioned earlier in this document. Now you want to add a couple of variations named Swashbuckler (for that seafood design) and Latte (for the coffee shop design). This is how your theme files would be organized:

```
/your-theme-folder
	/styles
		/latte.json
		/swashbuckler.json
	/theme.json
```

Style variations are simply variations of `theme.json`, so you have full access to everything in the `theme.json` specification at your fingertips.

The second difference between `theme.json` and style variations is the variation title. You can configure this by adding the `title` property to your custom JSON files.

Building off the Latte variation example above, you would open your `/styles/latte.json` file and add it, as shown in this code snippet:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"title": "Latte",
	"settings": {},
	"styles": {}
}
```

The `title` field is used to represent your variation in the user interface. It is not a required field (WordPress will fall back to your variation), but it does make for a nicer user experience.

## Style variations vs. child themes

If you are familiar with the concept of [child themes](#themes/advanced-topics/child-themes), which are covered in the [Advanced Topics](#themes/advanced-topics) documentation, you may be wondering what the differences between them and style variations are.

The most obvious difference is that a style variation is limited to a single JSON file that overrides the primary `theme.json`, whereas a child theme can override anything from its parent theme. So it’s probably better to look at the one area they are similar: the JSON file itself.

In a child theme, the `theme.json` simply overrides its parent’s `theme.json` file. In a style variation—and this is where the major difference occurs—the variation’s JSON file overrides the `theme.json` file and **its data is saved to the database**.

Once a user selects a style variation of a theme, everything in the variation’s JSON file is treated as a user customization. Essentially, WordPress stores that **initial** data in the same way as if the user had simply designed the colors, typography, spacing, etc. from the interface. This is an important distinction to make because it means that when you update a style variation in a future theme release, the user will not receive those changes if they have already saved the style variation.

It is possible for users to switch to a variation and switch back to the one they were using to get the update.

Style variations can be a great feature to add to your theme, but they have a specific use case. Sometimes child themes make more sense.

# Appearance Tools <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/appearance-tools" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/appearance-tools/

`settings.appearanceTools` is a unique property in `theme.json` that behaves as a catchall for multiple other properties. Compared to other settings that you can configure, this one makes it easy to enable several design-related settings in one go.

## Opting into appearance tools

`settings.appearanceTools` enables several features related to the design or the *appearance* of a site. By default, the value is set to `false`, so if you choose to not use this property, you can simply not add it to your `theme.json`.

However, if you want to enable it, you can set it to `true`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"appearanceTools": true
	}
}
```

This is the equivalent of setting these properties individually in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"border": {
			"color": true,
			"radius": true,
			"style": true,
			"width": true
		},
		"color": {
			"link": true
		},
		"dimensions": {
			"minHeight": true
		},
		"position": {
			"sticky": true
		},
		"spacing": {
			"blockGap": true,
			"margin": true,
			"padding": true
		},
		"typography": {
			"lineHeight": true
		}
	}
}
```

As you can see, it can be a major time-saver and create much less work for you. With `settings.appearanceTools` enabled, you can skip setting those properties individually.

You can learn more about what each does via its documentation here in the handbook:

- [Border](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/border)
- [Color](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/color)
- [Dimensions](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/dimensions)
- [Position](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/position)
- [Spacing](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/spacing)
- [Typography](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/typography)

## Overwriting appearance tools

Just because you’ve enabled `appearanceTools` doesn’t mean that you cannot disable some features. You can do both.

Suppose that you wanted to enable all appearance tools but disable sticky positioning. You would use this code in your `theme.json` to do this:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"appearanceTools": true,
		"position": {
			"sticky": false
		}
	}
}
```

This gives you the best of both worlds. You can use `appearanceTools` to enable a large selection of settings but disable others on a case-by-case basis.

## Should I enable appearance tools?

There is one caveat to setting `appearanceTools` to `true` in your `theme.json` file: it can automatically opt your theme into design tools in the future. Sometimes, WordPress enables new features when this setting is enabled.

Because no one can reliably predict the future, you need to decide whether you want your theme to support unknown design features that you haven’t tested today.

For many publicly-distributed themes, this will not typically be an issue if you want to provide a lot of flexibility for your theme’s users. By enabling `appearanceTools`, you can give users new design features without updating your theme.

For agencies and freelancers, this could create issues for your clients. Often, these projects are meant to limit the user interface to only specific design tools that the client needs. If WordPress adds new appearance tools in a future update, it’s possible the client will see new and unfamiliar features. For this reason, leaving `appearanceTools` disabled will often make sense.

# Border <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/border" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/border/

The `settings.border` property in `theme.json` gives you control over the global border settings for blocks in WordPress. It’s important to note that this lets you configure the available settings in the user interface, not the border styles themselves.

Each of the border settings maps to a control at the individual block level and in the **Styles** interface for blocks, letting you curate which controls are available to your theme users:

[![WordPress post editor showing a Post Featured Image block with custom border settings.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/border-settings.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/border-settings.jpg?ssl=1)## Border settings

WordPress supports four border settings that you can configure via the `settings.border` property in `theme.json`. Each of them allows you to enable or disable a specific border feature and accepts a boolean (`true` or `false`) value:

- **`color`:** Enables/Disables the border-color picker.
- **`radius`:** Enables/Disables the border-radius control.
- **`style`:** Enables/Disables the border-style selector (users have the option of `solid`, `dashed`, or `dotted`).
- `<strong>width</strong>`: Enables/Disables the border-width input.

By default, all border properties are set to `false`, as shown in this example `theme.json` code:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"border": {
			"color": false,
			"radius": false,
			"style": false,
			"width": false
		}
	}
}
```

As of WordPress 6.3, `color`, `style`, and `width` are intertwined. If any one of them is set to `true`, the others will be available as options within the user interface.

Also, setting the `radius` option to `false` does not work for the Button block. The border-radius control in the editor always appears.

---

# Color <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/color" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/color/

Color is one of the primary components of design. You can create a theme that is dark and moody, fun and lighthearted, or clean and corporate. Which colors you choose will define how the world sees your theme, and WordPress provides a range of color-specific configuration options that you can set.

The `settings.color` property in `theme.json` gives you full control over how colors, gradients, and more work within your theme. Primarily, the goal is for configuring whether specific controls appear in the user interface, but it also lets you register custom presets that users can select.

## Color settings

`color` is an object that’s nested directly within the top-level `settings` property in `theme.json`. It is used to configure multiple color-specific settings that appear in the user interface.

Take a look at the `color` property in the context of a `theme.json` file with its default values:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"background": true,
			"custom": true,
			"customDuotone": true,
			"customGradient": true,
			"defaultDuotone": true,
			"defaultGradients": true,
			"defaultPalette": true,
			"duotone": [],
			"gradients": [],
			"link": true,
			"palette": [],
			"text": true
		}
	}
}
```

As you can see, most of the settings accept a boolean value, meaning that you can set them to either `true` or `false`. Others, like `duotone`, `gradients`, and `palette` take an array of values. These are the ones where you can register custom presets, and you will learn how to create them in this doc.

Color settings can largely be broken down into four groups that let you:

- Enable or disable settings in the UI.
- Enable or disable user customizations of colors, duotones filters, and gradients.
- Enable or disable the core WordPress color, duotone, and gradient presets.
- Register custom color, duotone, and gradient presets.

In the following sections, you will learn how each of these work.

## Text, background, and link settings

In the block editor, you will often see **Text**, **Background**, and **Link** settings under the **Color** panel for a block, at least for those blocks that opt into support of one or more of them.

These options appear like this in the interface:

[![WordPress post editor with a Paragraph block that has a blue background. On the right, the Background color picker is open, revealing various color options.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/theme-json-color-options.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/theme-json-color-options.jpg?ssl=1)But just because a block registers support for text, background, and link colors doesn’t mean that your theme must also support them. That’s entirely up to you.

WordPress lets you decide whether your theme supports any or all of the settings by defining the `background`, `link`, and `text` properties under `settings.color` in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"background": true,
			"link": true,
			"text": true
		}
	}
}
```

By default, all are set to `true`, so their associated controls will appear in the block interface. If you want to disable a feature, you only need to set its value to `false` in your `theme.json`.

For an exercise, try disabling the background color but still allow text and link colors:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"background": false,
			"link": true,
			"text": true
		}
	}
}
```

Some core WordPress blocks and third-party blocks may have other color options that users can configure. These cannot be enabled or disabled via `theme.json` since they are not a standard component of the color system.

## Enabling and disabling user customizations

One of the major decisions that you will need to make for your theme is whether you want to allow users to create custom colors. On the one hand, enabling custom colors gives users a ton of flexibility and freedom to truly make their site their own. But maybe you’ve put in a lot of work getting the color scheme *just right* and want to make sure the user is only picking colors from a predetermined palette.

This may change depending on whether you are building a publicly-distributed theme vs. one for a client. Each project is unique, and you get to be the judge on what’s best for your design.

WordPress currently allows user-customized colors for three different features, which you can enable or disable via `theme.json`:

- **`custom`:** Whether the user can create and use custom colors.
- **`customDuotone`:** Whether the user can create custom duotone filters (typically used for overlays on blocks with images).
- **`customGradient`:** Whether the user can create custom background gradients.

By default, each of these features are enabled in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"custom": true,
			"customDuotone": true,
			"customGradient": true
		}
	}
}
```

### User-customized colors

When the `settings.colors.custom` value is set to `true` (the default), users will be able to define custom colors for individual blocks, as shown here:

[![WordPress post editor with a Paragraph block in the editor with a blue background. The Text color option is open and shows a user selecting a custom color.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/theme-json-custom-colors.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/theme-json-custom-colors.jpg?ssl=1)Because this is enabled by default, try turning it off by setting the property to `false` in your `theme.json` file:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"custom": false
		}
	}
}
```

Now users will only be able to select from preset colors.

### User-customized duotone filters

Duotone filters are generally supported by blocks that display an image. The filter is applied as an overlay above the image, creating a duotone effect. The two-color filter allows users to select a shadow and highlight color.

By default, users can create custom duotone filters as shown here:

[![WordPress post editor showing an Image block with the custom duotone filters option open.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/theme-json-custom-duotone-scaled.jpg?resize=2560%2C1333&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/theme-json-custom-duotone-scaled.jpg?ssl=1)Since custom duotone filters are enabled by default, you must set the `settings.color.customDuotone` property to `false` if you do not want to allow users to add custom colors:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"customDuotone": false
		}
	}
}
```

### User-customized gradients

Like most other color settings, custom gradients are enabled by default. This allows your theme users to define a gradient background for any block that supports it as shown here:

[![WordPress post editor with a Cover block shown. In the right sidebar, the gradient picker is open for the Overlay option.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/theme-json-custom-gradients.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/theme-json-custom-gradients.jpg?ssl=1)If you’ve carefully fine-tuned the gradients you want available to the user or simply want to disable custom gradients altogether, you can turn this feature off by setting `settings.color.customGradient` to `false` in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"customGradient": false
		}
	}
}
```

## Default WordPress presets

WordPress creates its own presets for each of the color features. As is the case with user-defined colors, you will need to decide whether you want to give users access to these. They will often clash with your theme’s color palette, but you may also opt to give users complete freedom to decide on their own.

WordPress currently allows user-customized colors for three different features, which you can enable or disable via `theme.json`:

- `<strong>defaultDuotone</strong>`: Whether the user can select from WordPress’ default duotone filter presets (typically used for overlays on blocks with images).
- **`defaultGradients`:** Whether the user can select from WordPress’ default background gradient presets.
- **`defaultPalette`:** Whether the user can select colors from WordPress’ default color palette.

By default, each of these features are enabled in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"defaultDuotone": true,
			"defaultGradients": true,
			"defaultPalette": true
		}
	}
}
```

It’s important to note that, even if these settings are disabled, WordPress will still generate the CSS custom properties for its presets. This is for backward-compatibility and so that users do not lose colors, gradients, or duotone filters that they have previously chosen when using another theme.

### Default color palette

WordPress ships with its own color palette, which is enabled by default for themes that have not opted out of it. It contains the following colors:

- Black
- Cyan bluish gray
- White
- Pale pink
- Vivid red
- Luminous vivid orange
- Luminous vivid amber
- Light green cyan
- Vivid green cyan
- Pale cyan blue
- Vivid cyan blue
- Vivid purple

Color presets are available for the **Text**, **Background**, **Link**, and potentially other color controls as shown in this screenshot:

[![WordPress post editor with a Group block wrapping a Paragraph. The Text color option is highlighted in the right sidebar.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/default-colors.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/default-colors.jpg?ssl=1)There are times when you might want to disable the core WordPress colors, and you can do so by setting `settings.color.defaultPalette` to `false` in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"defaultPalette": false
		}
	}
}
```

### Default duotone filters

WordPress has several default duotone filter presets that it defines:

- Dark Grayscale
- Grayscale
- Purple and yellow
- Blue and red
- Midnight
- Magenta and yellow
- Purple and green
- Blue and orange

These will appear for blocks that support duotone filters (generally used as an overlay for blocks with images), as shown here:

[![WordPress post editor with a purple and yellow duotone filter applied to an Image in the content canvas.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/default-duotone-filters.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/default-duotone-filters.jpg?ssl=1)If you do not want to allow your theme users to select from the default duotone presets, you must set `settings.color.defaultDuotone` to `false` in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"defaultDuotone": false
		}
	}
}
```

### Default gradients

By default, WordPress defines several gradients for users to pick and choose from. These can be added to blocks that support gradient backgrounds:

- Vivid cyan blue to vivid purple
- Light green cyan to vivid green cyan
- Luminous vivid amber to luminous vivid orange
- Luminous vivid orange to vivid red
- Very light gray to cyan bluish gray
- Cool to warm spectrum
- Blush light purple
- Blush bordeaux
- Luminous dusk
- Pale ocean
- Electric grass
- Midnight

They appear as shown here in the **Background &gt; Gradient** control in the user interface:

[![WordPress post editor with a Group block and a purple and orange background gradient selected.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/default-gradients.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/default-gradients.jpg?ssl=1)The core WordPress gradient presets are enabled by default, but there are times when you may want to disable them for your theme. You can do so by setting `settings.color.defaultGradients` to `false` in your `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"defaultGradients": false
		}
	}
}
```

## Registering custom color presets

Just like WordPress defines its own color, duotone, and gradient presets, so can you. This is a powerful feature that allows you to customize how your theme looks on the front end of the site and which colors your theme users can select from in the block editor.

You can set presets for three different features via `theme.json`:

- `<strong>duotone</strong>`: An array of duotone filters that a user can choose from (typically used for overlays on blocks with images).
- `<strong>gradients</strong>`: An array of background gradient objects that a user can choose from.
- **`palette`:** An array of color objects that a user can choose from.

Here is what this would look like in `theme.json` (note that there are no presets yet registered):

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"duotone": [],
			"gradients": [],
			"palette": []
		}
	}
}
```

WordPress will automatically generate CSS custom properties for each of your presets in the form of `--wp--preset--{type}--{slug}`. So a color palette preset with the slug of `contrast` will become `--wp--preset--color--contrast`.

You can access these in your `theme.json` styles via the CSS custom property itself or through a special naming convention of `var:preset|{type}|{slug}`. You will learn more about this in the `theme.json` [Styles documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jFI5wPr3cjaac4xDaH7OIwc5QqDo1OAGNHt23zR7Sb4/edit#).

WordPress will also sometimes generate CSS classes based on the preset. For example, the `contrast` color palette preset will have an associated class for `.has-contrast-color` when used as a block’s text color and `.has-contrast-background-color` when used as a background.

### Custom color palette

When building a theme you will almost always want to register your own color palette. For some themes, this may be as simple as a couple of colors. Others could potentially include dozens of colors.

In the end, it’s your theme, and WordPress gives you the tools to build your design.

You can register custom colors via the `settings.color.palette` property in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"palette": []
		}
	}
}
```

The `palette` property accepts an array of color objects, and each of those objects has three properties that you must set:

- `<strong>color</strong>`: A valid CSS color value.
- **`name`:** The label for your color, which will be internationalized (so that it can be translated) and shown to the user in some contexts, such as tooltips.
- **`slug`:** A unique machine-readable slug/ID for your color. This is used to generate CSS custom properties and CSS classes.

Suppose you wanted to register three colors named Base, Contrast, and Primary for your theme. They would appear in the color picker like so:

[![WordPress post editor showing a Group block around a Paragraph. The Group has a thick blue border and black text selected.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/theme-color-palette.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/theme-color-palette.jpg?ssl=1)For your custom colors to appear in the interface, you must add them to the `settings.color.palette` array as shown in this code snippet:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"palette": [
				{
					"color": "#ffffff",
					"name": "Base",
					"slug": "base"
				},
				{
					"color": "#000000",
					"name": "Contrast",
					"slug": "contrast"
				},
				{
					"color": "#89CFF0",
					"name": "Primary",
					"slug": "primary"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

You can add as few or as many colors as you want, and there are no official naming schemes.

Despite there not being an official naming scheme for colors, the `base` and `contrast` slugs are *de facto* standards [that were set forth](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/563) by the Twenty Twenty-Three default theme. It is recommended to use `base` for the site background and `contrast` for text. This provides the greatest future-proofing and compatibility between themes. It also gives plugin authors a standard set of fallback colors when needed.

### Custom gradients

Like colors, you can also register a custom set of gradient presets. And there are no limits on the number of gradients your theme can support, so go wild and have a bit of fun!

You can register custom gradients via the `settings.color.gradients` property in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"gradients": []
		}
	}
}
```

The `gradients` property accepts an array of gradient objects, and each of those objects has three properties that you must set:

- **`gradient`:** A valid CSS background gradient value.
- **`name`:** The label for your gradient, which will be internationalized (so that it can be translated) and shown to the user in some contexts, such as tooltips.
- **`slug`:** A unique machine-readable slug/ID for your gradient. This is used to generate CSS custom properties and CSS classes.

Let’s suppose you have a couple of gradients named Emerald and Fabled Sunset that you want to add for your theme as shown here:

[![WordPress post editor with a Group block that has a Purple to Yellow gradient background.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/theme-gradients.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/theme-gradients.jpg?ssl=1)Add the following to your `theme.json` to register them:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"gradients": [
				{
					"gradient": "linear-gradient(to right, #10b981, #64a30d)",
					"name": "Emerald",
					"slug": "emerald"
				},
				{
					"gradient": "linear-gradient(-225deg,#231557,#44107a 29%,#ff1361 67%,#fff800)",
					"name": "Fabled Sunset",
					"slug": "fabled-sunset"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

### Custom duotone filters

Like colors and gradients, you can register any number of custom duotone filters for your theme. This will allow your users to apply customizations directly to Image and other blocks that support duotone.

You can register custom gradients via the `settings.color.duotone` property in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"duotone": []
		}
	}
}
```

The `duotone` property accepts an array of duotone objects, and each of those objects has three properties that you must set:

- **`colors`:** An array containing two valid CSS color values.
- **`name`:** The label for your duotone filter, which will be internationalized (so that it can be translated) and shown to the user in some contexts, such as tooltips.
- **`slug`:** A unique machine-readable slug/ID for your duotone filter. This is used to generate CSS custom properties and CSS classes.

Suppose you wanted to create to create two duotone filters—one for red shadows and highlights and a similar one for blues, as shown below:

[![WordPress post editor with a blue-tinted duotone filter applied to an Image block.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/theme-duotone-filters.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/theme-duotone-filters.jpg?ssl=1)To register the Red and Blue dutone filters, add this code to your `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json",
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"duotone": [
				{
					"colors": [
						"#450a0a",
						"#fef2f2"
					],
					"name": "Red",
					"slug": "red"
				},
				{
					"colors": [
						"#172554",
						"#eff6ff"
					],
					"name": "Blue",
					"slug": "blue"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

Duotone does not currently support CSS custom properties or references and cannot be dynamically generated. There is an [open ticket](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33905) to solve this issue.

# Custom <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/custom" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/custom/

The `settings.custom` property is unique among other settings in `theme.json`. As its name implies, it is a custom property. This means that you get to decide how to use it. Essentially, it provides a method for creating CSS custom properties that you might need elsewhere in your theme.

In this document, you will learn what the `custom` property is for and how you can use it in your theme.

## Overview of the custom setting

The `settings.custom` property accepts a single object, and this object can be used to store other values. The individual object values must be valid CSS values or an object with nested key/value pairs.

Here is an example snippet from `theme.json` with no custom values set:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"custom": {}
	}
}
```

The great thing about the `settings.custom` object is that you can use it to create your own CSS custom properties. When you add a key and value to the object, WordPress will automatically generate the CSS custom property, assign the value, and load it for you.

The generated CSS custom property will follow this pattern: `--wp--custom--{key}--{value}`.

Suppose you wanted to use the key of `fruit` and give it a value of `apple`. Add this to your `theme.json` file:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"custom": {
			"fruit": "apple"
		}
	}
}
```

WordPress will then generate this CSS:

```css
body {
	--wp--custom--fruit: apple;
}
```

## How CSS custom properties are generated

As you learned above, the `settings.custom.fruit` key name will generate the `--wp--custom--fruit` variable in CSS. But there are other cases too.

### Automatic hyphenation

WordPress will automatically hyphenate camel-cased names. For example, `lineHeight` in the following example will become `line-height`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"custom": {
			"lineHeight": "1.4em"
		}
	}
}
```

This will create the following CSS:

```css
body {
	--wp--custom--line-height: 1.4em;
}
```

Numbers are handled the same as uppercase letters when used as a key. For example, a key of `abc123` will become `abc-1-2-3` in the resulting CSS.

### Nested properties

Building off the above example, suppose you wanted to create several line-height CSS custom properties for use in your theme. For this, you might want to create an object under `settings.custom.lineHeight` instead of a single value.

Add the following to your `theme.json` file:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"custom": {
			"lineHeight": {
				"xs": "1",
				"sm": "1.25",
				"md": "1.5",
				"lg": "1.75"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

WordPress will automatically use this nested structure when generating the CSS custom property names.

This will generate this CSS:

```css
body {
	--wp--custom--line-height--xs: 1;
	--wp--custom--line-height--sm: 1.25;
	--wp--custom--line-height--md: 1.5;
	--wp--custom--line-height--lg: 1.75;
}
```

There is no limit to the amount of nesting you can do, but keep in mind that the more you nest, the longer your CSS custom property names become.

## Practical usage

What you use the `settings.custom` property for is entirely up to you. At its core, all it really does is generate CSS custom properties, which don’t do anything on their own. Custom properties must also be used in CSS.

In the previous `theme.json` example above, you created a set of line-heights. There are a number of ways you can put these into practical use.

### Use in theme.json styles

In the [Styles documentation](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles), you will learn how to apply styles to the root element, elements, and blocks via `theme.json`. This will be one of the primary use cases for integrating with `settings.custom`.

Suppose you wanted to register the same set of line-heights from above and make use of them. Maybe you want to set the root element to the `md` line-height and Paragraph blocks to `lg`. You can access each line-height property via `var:custom|line-height|md` and `var:custom|line-height|lg`, respectively.

Use this code in your `theme.json` file:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"custom": {
			"lineHeight": {
				"xs": "1",
				"sm": "1.25",
				"md": "1.5",
				"lg": "1.75"
			}
		}
	},
	"styles": {
		"typography": {
			"lineHeight": "var:custom|line-height|md"
		}
		"blocks": {
			"core/paragraph": {
				"typography": {
					"lineHeight": "var:custom|line-height|lg"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

You can also reference the values via their CSS custom properties. For example, instead of using `var:custom|line-height|md`, use `var( --wp--custom--line-height--md )`.

Remember, you will learn more about styling via `theme.json` from the [Styles documentation](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles/). You can use what you learn there to combine with the techniques outlined here.

### Use in CSS

There are times when you might need to reference the generated CSS custom properties directly in CSS, such as your `style.css` file. To do this, you must use the CSS custom property name.

Suppose you needed to target a class with the name of `.example-class` and to give it the `sm` line-height that you’ve registered. Use this code in your CSS:

```css
.example-class {
	line-height: var( --wp--custom--line-height--sm );
}
```

# Dimensions <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/dimensions" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/dimensions/

The `settings.dimensions` property in `theme.json` gives you control over the global dimensions settings for blocks. This property lets you decide which dimension controls are available in the user interface.

In this document, you will learn what the `dimensions` property is for and how you can use it in your theme.

## Dimensions settings

`dimensions` is an object that’s nested directly within the top-level `settings` property in `theme.json`. Currently, it only lets you set a single property:

- **`minHeight`:** A boolean value for enabling block support for the **Minimum Height** control.

Take a look at the `dimensions` property in the context of a `theme.json` file with its default values:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"dimensions": {
			"minHeight": false
		}
	}
}
```

### Minimum Height

The `settings.dimensions.minHeight` property lets you control whether the **Minimum Height** field appears for blocks that have opted into support for the feature. As of WordPress 6.3, the only core WordPress blocks that do are Group and Post Content.

To enable support for the control, you must set the property’s value to `true` in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"dimensions": {
			"minHeight": true
		}
	}
}
```

This will enable the control in the interface. As shown in this screenshot, the **Minimum Height** field appears for the Group block (Stack variation):

[![WordPress post editor with a Stack block in the content canvas. Its minimum height is set in the sidebar.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/group-min-height.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/group-min-height.jpg?ssl=1)

# Layout <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/layout" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/layout/

The `settings.layout` property in `theme.json` is an object that stores layout-related settings that you can configure. At the moment, it is used for setting “content” and “wide” widths, but it could also be used for other settings in the future.

In this document, you will learn what the `layout` property is used for and how you can use it in your theme.

## Layout settings

`layout` is an object that’s nested directly within the top-level `settings` property in `theme.json`. Within that object, you can define two settings:

- `<strong>contentSize</strong>`: A valid CSS length value for defining the default width for content. It is typically used for controlling the width of the post content and related areas on the page.
- **`wideSize`:** A valid CSS length value for defining the default wide alignment width, which is generally between the content size and full viewport width.

Take a look at the `layout` property in the context of a `theme.json` file with its default values:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"layout": {
			"contentSize": "",
			"wideSize": ""
		}
	}
}
```

### Content size

The `settings.layout.contentSize` property is primarily useful for defining the width of a site’s content area. Think of this as the default width of your site. You can break outside of this by applying the “wide” (below) or “full” width to a block. The content width is merely the foundation.

In almost any design, you will want to limit this width to something that is comfortable to read, especially if the content is going to include text. This is a value that you will need to determine for yourself, but a good rule of thumb is that you should have 45-75 characters of text per line (though some guidelines differ slightly on the number range). Of course, your default font-family and font-size are crucial pieces to figuring this out.

Try configuring a content size in your `theme.json` file:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"layout": {
			"contentSize": "40rem"
		}
	}
}
```

If you open a template in the **Site Editor**, you can use it to define the layout for various blocks. In the screenshot below, you can see that the Post Content block has the **Inner blocks use content width** option selected under the **Layout** tab:

[![WordPress post editor with a Post Content block selected, showing its inner content limited to the content width.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/content-size.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/content-size.jpg?ssl=1)What this setting does is tell WordPress that any nested blocks within the Post Content block should be set to the `40rem` value defined for `settings.layout.contentSize` in `theme.json`.

### Wide Size

The `settings.layout.wideSize` property defines a width for “wide” blocks. To be useful, wide blocks must be nested within a block that is telling WordPress that its inner blocks should be limited to the “content” size. Wide-aligned blocks are meant to “break outside” of their parent block.

Not every theme will benefit by having a wide size. Depending on the design, a theme’s layout may simply not have additional room for blocks to break out of their container. In those cases, you do not need to set this value.

For theme designs that can accommodate wide blocks (typical of sidebar-less designs), you will want to set this to a value that is greater than `settings.layout.contentWidth`. But it shouldn’t stretch to the width of the full screen (e.g., `100vw`). WordPress has a separate full-width setting that you can use for that.

Try adding a custom `settings.layout.wideSize` to your `theme.json` file (remember, you need a set content size for this to be useful):

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"layout": {
			"contentSize": "40rem",
			"wideSize": "64rem"
		}
	}
}
```

Now open your **Site Editor** in the WordPress admin and edit a template. First, add a **Group** block with the **Inner blocks use content width** option enabled. Then, stick another block within it and select the **Wide width** option.

In the screenshot below, you can see the Post Featured Image block nested within a Group block. It breaks out of its parent container but the other post-related blocks are limited to the content width:

[![WordPress site editor with the Post Featured Image block selected and set to "wide width".](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/wide-size.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/wide-size.jpg?ssl=1)

# Lightbox <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/lightbox" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/lightbox/

`settings.lightbox` is a specific setting that you can enable for supported blocks. It enables a lightbox feature that expands an image when a site visitor clicks on an image.

This setting is only available as of WordPress 6.4 and is specific to the core Image block (`core/image`).

## Lightbox settings

The `lightbox` setting is specific to the Image block, so the following examples will be shown in that context.

The `lightbox` property is an object that has two nested properties that you can configure:

- **`enabled`:** Whether to enable the lightbox feature for the Image block. The default value is `undefined` (the equivalent of being disabled).
- **`allowEditing`:** Whether to show the **Expand on click** option in the interface, which allows the user to enable/disable lightbox for individual images. Defaults to `true`.

Here is a look at the default `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"blocks": {
			"core/image": {
				"lightbox": {
					"allowEditing": true
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Enabling lightbox for images

To enable the lightbox feature for Image blocks used throughout the site, you must set `settings.blocks.core/image.lightbox.enabled` to true in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"blocks": {
			"core/image": {
				"lightbox": {
					"enabled": true
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

On the front-end of the site, visitors will be able to expand the image when clicking on it. The image will then overlay the entire screen (including an **x** button for closing the overlay), as shown below:

[![Image of palm trees expanded as an overlay modal.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/lightbox-expanded.jpg?resize=2048%2C959&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/lightbox-expanded.jpg?ssl=1)### Disabling user editing

By default, WordPress will show an **Expand on Click** option under the **Settings** tab for the Image block:

[![WordPress post editor with an Image block showing the "expand on click" option selected.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/lightbox-allow-editing.jpg?resize=2048%2C1056&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/lightbox-allow-editing.jpg?ssl=1)This control allows your theme’s users to enable or disable the lightbox feature on a per-block basis.

To disallow user editing, you must set `settings.blocks.core/image.lightbox.allowEditing` to `false` in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"blocks": {
			"core/image": {
				"lightbox": {
					"allowEditing": false
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

# Position <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/position" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/position/

The `settings.position` property in `theme.json` gives you control over the global positioning settings for blocks in WordPress. It’s important to note that this lets you configure the available settings in the user interface, not the position styles.

## Position settings

`position` is an object that’s nested directly within the top-level `settings` property in `theme.json`. Currently, it only lets you set a single property:

- **`sticky`:** A boolean value for enabling block support for the **Position: Sticky** option.

Take a look at the `position` property in the context of a `theme.json` file with its default values:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"position": {
			"sticky": false
		}
	}
}
```

### Enabling sticky positioning

Sticky positioning can be particularly useful in theme designs that feature a header that sticks to the top of the screen as the user scrolls down the page. This is one of the primary use cases, but it can also be useful in other scenarios.

Setting a block to the sticky position will stick the block to its most immediate parent when the user scrolls the page. Sticky positioning is only possible if enabled in `theme.json`.

To enable sticky positioning for blocks that support it, set `settings.position.sticky` to `true`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"position": {
			"sticky": true
		}
	}
}
```

This will enable a new **Position** tab in the block inspector controls (for blocks that support the position feature, such as Group). The control will show a dropdown select with the available position options: **Default** and **Sticky**:

[![WordPress site editor with the Header template part selected. In the right sidebar, the Sticky option is selected for the Position setting.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/position-sticky-header.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/position-sticky-header.jpg?ssl=1)

If you want to create a sticky header, note that you cannot use positioning on the Header template part. You must wrap it with a containing Group block and apply the sticky positioning to the Group.

# Shadow <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/shadow" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/shadow/

The `settings.shadow` property in `theme.json` currently lets you create custom shadow presets. As of WordPress 6.3, it contains no settings for enabling or disabling UI elements.

Shadow, in this case, refers specifically to the `box-shadow` CSS feature and is unrelated to `text-shadow`.

## Shadow settings

The `settings.shadow` property contains two settings that you can configure:

- **`defaultPresets`:** A boolean value for enabling or disabling the default WordPress shadow presets. Defaults to `true`.
- `<strong>presets</strong>`: An array of objects for registering custom shadows for use in your theme or by users.

Here is a look at the default shadow property in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"shadow": {
			"defaultPresets": true,
			"presets": [
				{
					"name": "Natural",
					"slug": "natural",
					"shadow": "6px 6px 9px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)"
				},
				{
					"name": "Deep",
					"slug": "deep",
					"shadow": "12px 12px 50px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)"
				},
				{
					"name": "Sharp",
					"slug": "sharp",
					"shadow": "6px 6px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)"
				},
				{
					"name": "Outlined",
					"slug": "outlined",
					"shadow": "6px 6px 0px -3px rgba(255, 255, 255, 1), 6px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"
				},
				{
					"name": "Crisp",
					"slug": "crisp",
					"shadow": "6px 6px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

As you can see, WordPress registers several default presets that you can use directly in your block styles or that users can select from the interface:

- Natural
- Deep
- Sharp
- Outline
- Crisp

Like all presets, WordPress will generate a CSS custom property for each registered shadow. Shadow presets are named `--wp--preset--shadow--{$slug}`.

Here is an example of the CSS generated for the default shadow presets:

```css
body {
	--wp--preset--shadow--natural: 6px 6px 9px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
	--wp--preset--shadow--deep: 12px 12px 50px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
	--wp--preset--shadow--sharp: 6px 6px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
	--wp--preset--shadow--outlined: 6px 6px 0px -3px rgba(255, 255, 255, 1), 6px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
	--wp--preset--shadow--crisp: 6px 6px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
}
```

## Disabling core WordPress shadows

The default shadows available in core will not match the design of every theme. Typically, they will only work well for themes with a white or very light gray background. If your theme uses a different color, you will almost always want to remove these.

But there may be other reasons to disable the defaults. Perhaps you want to limit users to only the shadows that you’ve specifically designed for your theme or simply not like their design.

Whatever the reason, you can remove them by setting `settings.shadow.defaultPresets` to `false` in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"shadow": {
			"defaultPresets": false
		}
	}
}
```

## Adding custom shadow presets

WordPress lets you register any number of custom shadows. You can add them via the `settings.shadow.presets` property, which is an array used for storing shadow objects. Each object in this array should contain three values:

- **`name`:** A human-readable name or label for the shadow that can be translated.
- **`slug`:** A machine-readable slug for the shadow, which is used to build its associated CSS custom property.
- **`shadow`:** A valid CSS value for the `box-shadow` CSS property.

Try your hand at registering a few shadows of your own. You can use this `theme.json` code to get started, which contains several shadow examples:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json",
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"shadow": {
			"presets": [
				{
					"name": "Small",
					"slug": "sm",
					"shadow": "0 1px 2px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05)"
				},
				{
					"name": "Medium",
					"slug": "md",
					"shadow": "0 1px 3px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 1px 2px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)"
				},
				{
					"name": "Large",
					"slug": "lg",
					"shadow": "0 4px 6px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 2px 4px -2px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)"
				},
				{
					"name": "XL",
					"slug": "xl",
					"shadow": "0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)"
				},
				{
					"name": "2XL",
					"slug": "2-xl",
					"shadow": "0 20px 25px -5px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 8px 10px -6px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)"
				},
				{
					"name": "Inner",
					"slug": "inner",
					"shadow": "inset 0 2px 4px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05)"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

Currently, this only shows a shadow option for the core Button block in the user interface. This control can be accessed via **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Styles &gt; Style Book** in the WordPress admin. From there, select the **Button** block and locate the **Shadow** option in the **Effects** tab, as shown here:

[![WordPress Style Book screen with the Button block highlighted. It has a gray drop-shadow.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/shadow-ui-buttons.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/shadow-ui-buttons.jpg?ssl=1)It’s possible for third-party blocks to also utilize shadow presets and show them in the interface in the post, template, or site editors.

Like other presets, you can also use your custom shadows (or core WordPress shadows) in [`theme.json` Styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles).

For a deeper dive into this feature, read [Using the box-shadow feature for themes](#news/2023/01/using-the-box-shadow-feature-for-themes) on the WordPress Developer Blog.

# Spacing <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/spacing" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/spacing/

Spacing is one of the most complex parts of web design. It involves combining things like margin, padding, gap, line height, font size, and more into a harmonious flow. Doing this well requires a keen eye and a foundational understanding of how each of these pieces come together.

The `settings.spacing` property in `theme.json` covers settings related specifically to margin, padding, and gap.

This handbook also has documentation for [typography settings](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/typography) and [applying styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles) to blocks, both of which play roles in wrangling the spacing for your overall design.

## Spacing settings

The `settings.spacing` object has several properties that you can configure:

- **`blockGap`:** Whether to enable the **Block Spacing** option for blocks that support it. Can be a boolean value (`true`/`false`). Defaults to `null`. If set to null, WordPress’ generated CSS is also disabled.
- **`margin`:** Whether to enable the **Margin** option for supported blocks. Defaults to `false`.
- **`padding`:** Whether to enable the **Padding** option for supported blocks. Defaults to `false`.
- **`customSpacingSize`:** Whether to allow users to input custom spacing values for supported blocks. Defaults to `true`.
- **`spacingScale`:** A configuration object for defining a custom spacing scale. WordPress defines a default scale with seven steps that increment by `1.5rem`.
- **`spacingSizes`:** An array of custom size objects that may overrule the spacing scale or add to it.
- **`units`:** An array of possible CSS units that users can select from when adding custom spacing.

Here is what spacing settings look like the default WordPress `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"spacing": {
			"blockGap": null,
			"customSpacingSize": true,
			"margin": false,
			"padding": false,
			"spacingScale": {
				"operator": "*",
				"increment": 1.5,
				"steps": 7,
				"mediumStep": 1.5,
				"unit": "rem"
			},
			"spacingSizes": [],
			"units": [ "px", "em", "rem", "vh", "vw", "%" ]
		}
	}
}
```

## Enabling or disabling spacing options

As noted in the default settings in the previous section, there are several settings that are merely for enabling or disabling elements in the user interface. In this section, you will learn how to configure each of these.

### Enabling block spacing (block gap)

In WordPress, the “block gap” refers to the spacing between blocks on a page. In most cases, this is the vertical spacing between blocks. But it can also refer to horizontal spacing when blocks are set in horizontal flex or in a grid layout.

In flow layouts (the default), the block gap is applied using the CSS `margin-top` property to sibling elements. In flex or grid layouts, it is applied using the CSS `gap` property.

WordPress will automatically output the CSS for the block gap if this setting is not disabled entirely (the default).

You will learn more about defining block gap styles in the [Styles documentation](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles), but having a baseline understanding of the terminology should help you decide how to work with this option.

The primary purpose of the `settings.spacing.blockGap` is to enable or disable the user interface for the **Block Spacing** control for blocks that support it. You can do this by setting it to `true` or `false`.

However, you can also leave it as `null` (the default value). This disables the user interface. In addition, it removes the WordPress-generated block spacing CSS.

Leaving this to the default `null` value is not usually recommended except in special cases. Generally, you would want consistent spacing as part of your design’s vertical rhythm. If set to `null`, you will need to handle that manually via custom CSS.

Use this table as a reference when determining which value to assign to `settings.spacing.blockGap`:

| `blockGap` Value | Block Spacing Control | WordPress-generated CSS |
|---|---|---|
| `null` | No | No |
| `true` | Yes | Yes |
| `false` | No | Yes |

Now try configuring the setting. Open your `theme.json` file and set the property to `true`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"spacing": {
			"blockGap": true
		}
	}
}
```

For blocks that support the property, you should now see the **Block Spacing** control appear. Here is a screenshot of what that looks like on the Post Template block:

[![WordPress editor with a Query Loop block. In the sidebar, the Block Spacing dropdown is open.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/block-gap-post-template.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/block-gap-post-template.jpg?ssl=1)Because of the way the layout system works in WordPress, it will output CSS that is specific to individual containers to handle the gap between blocks nested within those containers. For the screenshot example, here’s what that CSS looks like:

```css
.wp-container-17.wp-container-17 > :first-child:first-child {
	margin-block-start: 0;
}
	
.wp-container-17.wp-container-17 > * {
	margin-block-start: var(--wp--preset--spacing--plus-4);
	margin-block-end: 0;
}
```

Of course, the ID (`17`) and value will be different on a case-by-case basis.

### Enabling margin and padding

The margin and padding settings are a little more straightforward. They are both disabled by default, and you can enable them by setting their values to `true` in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"spacing": {
			"margin": true,
			"padding": true
		}
	}
}
```

This will make the **Margin** and **Padding** controls appear for supported blocks in their inspector controls in the sidebar:

[![WordPress editor with a Query Loop block. In the sidebar, the Margin dropdown is shown.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/margin-padding-controls.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/margin-padding-controls.jpg?ssl=1)Of course, you are free to leave both of these to the default value of `false` or configure them to your liking.

### Disabling user-defined spacing sizes

When any one of the `blockGap`, `margin`, or `padding` spacing settings are enabled, WordPress will output a user interface for setting those values for blocks that support them. By default, users can select from a list of preset spacing sizes (see “Spacing scale and sizes” below) or input a custom value.

In this screenshot, you can see that there is a custom **Block Spacing** setting chosen for the Buttons block:

[![Three buttons in the post editor. In the sidebar, the Block Spacing option is shown.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/custom-spacing-size-buttons.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/custom-spacing-size-buttons.jpg?ssl=1)You may want to limit users to your predefined spacing scale or sizes for your theme. This is often a good idea if you want to ensure consistent spacing throughout your design.

To do this, you must set the `customSpacingSizes` setting to `false`. This disables the custom spacing option in the editor UI but leaves the control for the theme’s defined sizes available:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"spacing": {
			"customSpacingSize": false
		}
	}
}
```

With custom spacing sizes disabled, the **Block Spacing** option from the Buttons block example will be limited to the theme’s preset sizes:

[![Three buttons in the post editor. In the sidebar, the Block Spacing dropdown is shown.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/preset-spacing-buttons.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/preset-spacing-buttons.jpg?ssl=1)## Defining allowed spacing units

If you choose to enable the `settings.spacing.customSpaceSize` option covered in the previous section, you will need to make another choice: which CSS unit values will your theme allow?

By default, WordPress lets users select from a subset of possible CSS units (there are dozens in the CSS specification). To choose which units you want to support, you must add them into the `settings.spacing.units` array in `theme.json` (shown with the defaults):

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"spacing": {
			"units": [ "px", "em", "rem", "vh", "vw", "%" ]
		}
	}
}
```

The currently-allowed possible units that you can choose from are:

- `px`
- `%`
- `em`
- `rem`
- `vw`
- `vh`
- `vmin`
- `vmax`
- `ch`
- `ex`
- `cm`
- `mm`
- `in`
- `pc`
- `pt`

As of WordPress 6.3, the allowed units are limited to the above list. There is an [open ticket](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/52441) to expand these to support more modern units.

## Spacing scale and sizes

One of the most important things that you should configure in your `theme.json` file is your spacing presets. WordPress will generate these presets as CSS custom properties, loading them in the editor and front end.

Most designers will use some type of standard scaling system for handling spacing, and WordPress gives you the flexibility to use whatever system you choose.

There are two methods for registering your spacing presets:

- **`spacingScale`:** A generated scale based on your configuration values.
- **`spacingSizes`:** Completely custom-defined spacing sizes.

Technically, you can use both of these methods, mixing and matching them. But it is generally recommended to choose one over the other for simplicity.

Spacing presets appear as choices for the **Block Spacing**, **Margin**, and **Padding** block controls (for blocks that support them). This means that you can present users with spacing options that are specific to your theme. You can also use these presets in the [Styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles) section in your `theme.json` or custom CSS.

WordPress generates a default spacing scale, as shown in this table:

| CSS Custom Property | CSS Value | Label |
|---|---|---|
| `--wp-preset--spacing--20` | `0.44rem` | 2X-Small |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--30` | `0.67rem` | X-Small |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--40` | `1rem` | Small |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--50` | `1.5rem` | Medium |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--60` | `2.25rem` | Large |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--70` | `3.38rem` | X-Large |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--80` | `5.06rem` | 2X-Large |

It is unlikely that this scale matches your design. So you will want to choose a method for overriding these default values.

### Custom spacing scale

WordPress allows theme authors to create a custom spacing scale by providing a set of configuration instructions. Each step in the scale generates a custom CSS property with the slug of `--wp--preset--spacing--{step}` (steps appear in increments of 10, regardless of their value).

The `spacingScale` object has five sub-settings that themes can configure:

- **`operator`:** The operator used to increment the scale. The available options are `+` (addition) and `*` (multiplication). The default value is `*`.
- **`increment`:** A number in which to increment the scale by when used in conjunction with the `operator` setting. The default value is `1.5`.
- **`steps`:** The total number of steps in the scale. The default value is `7`.
- **`mediumStep`:** The medium value of the scale. The default value is `1.5`.
- **`unit`:** A valid CSS spacing unit. The available options are `px`, `em`, `rem`, `vh`, `vw`, and `%`. The default value is `rem`.

The following example is a custom scale with seven steps that increments by `0.25rem`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"spacing": {
			"spacingScale": {
				"operator": "+",
				"increment": 0.25,
				"steps": 7,
				"mediumStep": 1,
				"unit": "rem"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

As shown in the screenshot, you should see a range slider the **Padding**, **Margin**, and **Block Spacing** controls for setting your registered values:

[![Stack block in the WordPress post editor. In the sidebar, various spacing options are adjusted.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/spacing-scale.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/spacing-scale.jpg?ssl=1)

When there are seven or fewer spacing presets, the interface will show a range slider for spacing controls. But more than seven displays a dropdown select. This applies to both the `spacingScale` method used here and the `spacingSizes` method in the next section.

This table represents your custom spacing scale (compare to the default scale to see how things have changed):

| CSS Custom Property | CSS Value | Label |
|---|---|---|
| `--wp-preset--spacing--20` | `0.25rem` | 2X-Small |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--30` | `0.5rem` | X-Small |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--40` | `0.75rem` | Small |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--50` | `1rem` | Medium |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--60` | `1.25rem` | Large |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--70` | `1.5rem` | X-Large |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--80` | `1.75rem` | 2X-Large |

The `mediumStep` value is always assigned to the `--wp--preset--spacing--50` preset when WordPress generates the CSS, and the other preset slugs in the scale extend up/down from this middle number in increments of 10.

The spacing scale will never go below `--wp--preset--spacing--10`. For scales with more than 10 steps, the bottom end of the scale will not generate presets because the `mediumStep` is always set to `--wp--preset--spacing--50`.

#### Disable the spacing scale

If you want to disable WordPress’ spacing scale altogether, you can set `steps` to `0` in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"spacing": {
			"spacingScale": {
				"steps": 0
			}
		}
	}
}
```

This can be useful when choosing to register completely custom spacing sizes, as covered in the next section.

### Custom spacing sizes

If you want more precise control over the spacing options, you can build out the individual spacing sizes instead of using the WordPress spacing scale system. This provides control over each option’s name, size, and slug.

The `spacingSizes` property lets you define an array of size objects. Each size object accepts three values:

- **`name`:** The human-readable title for the size, which can be translated.
- **`size`:** A valid CSS size. This can be a number and unit, a fluid size using `clamp()`, or a reference to another custom CSS property.
- **`slug `:** The slug for the size, which will be appended to a generated CSS custom property: `--wp--preset--spacing--{slug}`.

The following is an example of creating a five-step scale that increments by `0.25rem`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"spacing": {
			"spacingSizes": [
				{
					"name": "Step 1",
					"size": "0.25rem",
					"slug": "10"
				},
				{
					"name": "Step 2",
					"size": "0.5rem",
					"slug": "20"
				},
				{
					"name": "Step 3",
					"size": "0.75rem",
					"slug": "30"
				},
				{
					"name": "Step 4",
					"size": "1rem",
					"slug": "40"
				},
				{
					"name": "Step 5",
					"size": "1.25rem",
					"slug": "50"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

You should see a range slider the **Padding**, **Margin**, and **Block Spacing** controls for setting your registered values, as shown here:

[![Stack block in the WordPress post editor. In the sidebar, various spacing options are adjusted.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/spacing-sizes.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/spacing-sizes.jpg?ssl=1)This table represents your custom spacing sizes:

| CSS Custom Property | CSS Value | Label |
|---|---|---|
| `--wp-preset--spacing--10` | `0.25rem` | Step 1 |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--20` | `0.5rem` | Step 2 |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--30` | `0.75rem` | Step 3 |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--40` | `1rem` | Step 4 |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--50` | `1.25rem` | Step 5 |

#### Creating fluid sizes

If you want to use fluid spacing, you must use the `settings.spacing.spacingSizes` method for controlling the size presets.

To use fluid sizes, you merely need to add them as the `size` parameter for each of the size objects under `settings.spacing.spacingSizes`. `clamp()`, `min()`, `max()`, and other valid CSS values are supported.

Here is an example of a seven-step fluid spacing scale registered as individual sizes in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"spacing": {
			"spacingSizes": [
				{
					"name": "Fluid Scale -3",
					"size": "clamp( 0.31rem, 0.11vw + 0.28rem,  0.35rem )",
					"slug": "minus-3"
				},
				{
					"name": "Fluid Scale -2",
					"size": "clamp( 0.47rem, 0.16vw + 0.42rem,  0.53rem )",
					"slug": "minus-2"
				},
				{
					"name": "Fluid Scale -1",
					"size": "clamp( 0.71rem, 0.25vw + 0.63rem,  0.79rem )",
					"slug": "minus-1"
				},
				{
					"name": "Fluid Scale +/- 0 (Base)",
					"size": "clamp( 1.06rem, 0.37vw + 0.95rem,  1.19rem )",
					"slug": "base"
				},
				{
					"name": "Fluid Scale +1",
					"size": "clamp( 1.20rem, 0.85vw + 0.94rem,  1.48rem )",
					"slug": "plus-1"
				},
				{
					"name": "Fluid Scale +2",
					"size": "clamp( 1.34rem, 1.5vw + 0.89rem,  1.86rem )",
					"slug": "plus-2"
				},
				{
					"name": "Fluid Scale +3",
					"size": "clamp( 1.86rem, 3.7vw + -0.05rem,  2.32rem )",
					"slug": "plus-3"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

This results in the following values, as shown in this table:

| CSS Custom Property | CSS Value | Label |
|---|---|---|
| `--wp-preset--spacing--minus-1` | `clamp( 0.31rem, 0.11vw + 0.28rem,  0.35rem )` | Fluid Scale -3 |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--minus-2` | `clamp( 0.47rem, 0.16vw + 0.42rem,  0.53rem )` | Fluid Scale -2 |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--minus-3` | `clamp( 0.71rem, 0.25vw + 0.63rem,  0.79rem )` | Fluid Scale -1 |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--base` | `clamp( 1.06rem, 0.37vw + 0.95rem,  1.19rem )` | Fluid Scale +/- 0 (Base) |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--plus-1` | `clamp( 1.20rem, 0.85vw + 0.94rem,  1.48rem )` | Fluid Scale +1 |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--plus-2` | `clamp( 1.34rem, 1.5vw + 0.89rem,  1.86rem )` | Fluid Scale +2 |
| `--wp-preset--spacing--plus-3` | `clamp( 1.86rem, 3.7vw + -0.05rem,  2.32rem )` | Fluid Scale +3 |

# Typography <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/typography" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/typography/

Typography is a wide-ranging subject in web design, and no single piece of documentation could do it justice. There are book-length works that dive into the finer details and articles aplenty across the web that teach best practices, tips, and tricks at length.

This guide will specifically get you up to speed with the available settings available via `settings.typography` in `theme.json`.

Typography is also tightly related to spacing in your theme, so you will need to familiarize yourself with the [spacing settings](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/spacing) to get the most out of both guides. You will also take what you learn from this documentation and apply it to your [`theme.json` styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles).

## Enabling and disabling typography options

There are several settings that are merely for enabling or disabling elements in the user interface. Each of these properties accept a boolean value, meaning that you can set them to either `true` or `false`.

Not every block will support every typography setting. Some are specific to a single block. For example, the `dropCap` property only works for Paragraph blocks. Others are widely used by almost any block with text, such as `customFontSize`.

These `settings.typography` properties let you enable or disable features in the interface:

- **`customFontSize`:** Whether to let users input custom font sizes. Defaults to `true`.
- **`dropCap`:** Whether users can enable a drop-cap for the first letter of the Paragraph block. Defaults to `true`.
- **`fontStyle`:** Whether users can select a custom font style. Defaults to `true`.
- **`fontWeight:`** Whether users can select a custom font weight. Weight ranges map to the standard **Thin** through **Black** font weights. Defaults to `true`.
- **`letterSpacing`:** Whether users can input a custom letter spacing value. Defaults to `false`.
- **`lineHeight`:** Whether users can input a custom line height for text. There is no way to register line-height presets, so this option enables a completely custom input. Defaults to `false`.
- **`textColumns`:** Whether to show a columns option for the block’s text. Defaults to `false`.
- **`textDecoration`:** Whether the user can set the text decoration for a block’s text. The available options are **None**, **Underline**, and **Strikethrough**. Defaults to `true`.
- **`textTransform`:** Whether the user can change the letter case for a block’s text. The available options are **None**, **Uppercase**, **Lowercase**, and **Capitalize**. Defaults to `true`.
- **`writingMode`:** Whether to enable the text **Orientation** in the interface, allowing users to choose between **Horizontal** and **Vertical** text. Defaults to `false`.

Here is what these typography settings look like in the default WordPress `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"typography": {
			"customFontSize": true,
			"dropCap": true,
			"fontStyle": true,
			"fontWeight": true,
			"letterSpacing": true,
			"lineHeight": false,
			"textColumns": false,
			"textDecoration": true,
			"textTransform": true,
			"writingMode": false
		}
	}
}
```

In this screenshot, take note of the **Typography** panel for the Paragraph block, which has every setting enabled:

[![WordPress post editor with a Heading and multiple Paragraph blocks inserted. In the right sidebar, nearly every typography option is shown.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/typography-panel.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/typography-panel.jpg?ssl=1)Depending on your theme’s audience, you will want to enable only the features that its users will need. For example, you may have a client who only needs to configure the font size. It wouldn’t make sense to show them every setting if it gets in the way of their workflow.

A note on drop caps: the current implementation feature is notoriously buggy with different font families, font sizes, and line heights. If you leave this feature enabled, be sure that you test that drop caps look good within your theme’s design. You may need to add custom CSS so that it matches your theme.

## Custom font families

WordPress lets you register as many font families as you want via the `settings.typography.fontFamilies` property in `theme.json`. You can add support for both system fonts (those that live on the visitor’s computer) or web fonts (custom fonts bundled with your theme). You’ll learn how to register both of these in this section.

These appear as options under the **Typography &gt; Font** field in the inspector panel for blocks that support selecting a font:

[![WordPress post editor with a Cover block with inner blocks nested. In the sidebar, the Font dropdown is shown.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/font-family.jpg?resize=2048%2C1064&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/font-family.jpg?ssl=1)The `settings.typography.fontFamilies` property is an empty array by default. You can register fonts by passing in font family objects with these properties:

- **`name`:** *(Required)* The human-readable title for the font family, which can be translated.
- **`slug`:** *(Required)* The slug for the size, which will be appended to a generated CSS custom property: `--wp--preset--font-family--{slug}`.
- **`fontFamily`:** *(Required)* A valid value that will map to the CSS `font-family` value. Generally, this will be a font stack (a list of families that the browser will try to use in order).
- **`fontFace`:** *(Optional)* An array of font faces that are mapped to the `@font-face` CSS at-rule. You only need to use this when bundling custom web fonts with your theme.

Here is what the font family setting looks like in the default WordPress `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"typography": {
			"fontFamilies": []
		}
	}
}
```

In the following subsections, you will first learn how to register system fonts. Then, you will take the next step and register a custom web font.

### Registering system fonts

System fonts are more straightforward than web fonts. You only need to know which fonts you want to use. For this exercise, let’s assume that you want to register two fonts that you will use in your theme:

- **Primary:** a transitional serif font stack that will look good across modern devices.
- **Secondary:** the user’s system UI font.

Add this code to your `theme.json` to register each of the fonts:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json",
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"typography": {
			"fontFamilies": [
				{
					"name": "Primary",
					"slug": "primary",
					"fontFamily": "Charter, 'Bitstream Charter', 'Sitka Text', Cambria, serif"
				},
				{
					"name": "Secondary",
					"slug": "secondary",
					"fontFamily": "system-ui, sans-serif"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

These options will now appear in the **Typography &gt; Font** dropdown for any blocks that support the feature.

WordPress will also generate two CSS custom properties with the `--wp--preset--font-family--{$slug}` format in both the editor and on the front end:

```css
body {
	--wp--preset--font-family--primary: Charter, 'Bitstream Charter', 'Sitka Text', Cambria, serif;
	--wp--preset--font-family--secondary: system-ui, sans-serif;
}
```

You can reference these as `var:preset|font-family|$slug` when you begin using them as [Styles in `theme.json`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles/). You can also reference them using `var( --wp--preset--font-family--{$slug} )` directly in CSS.

It is generally recommended to use a semantic naming scheme for your font family slugs so that they are more future proof when switching between child themes, style variations, and even from theme to theme. These examples use `primary` and `secondary` since those are widely used terms. It’s best to avoid naming your slugs so that they match the current font family.

### Registering web fonts (font faces)

Registering custom web fonts works in much the same way as system fonts. The big difference is that you need to add the `fontFace` property to your font family objects.

`fontFace` must be an array of font face objects. Each object accepts these properties that map to descriptors for the [`@font-face` CSS at-rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face):

- **`fontFamily`:** A valid CSS `font-family` descriptor.
- **`fontWeight`:** A range of CSS `font-weight` values.
- **`fontStyle`:** A valid CSS `font-style` value.
- **`fontStretch`:** A valid CSS font stretch value.
- **`src`:** An array of font file URLs where the font files are located (this can be used to support multiple formats, but only one is required).

The `src` property is unique in that it allows you to reference a URL that is relative to the `theme.json` file in your theme. Use the `"file:./path/to/file.ext"` format to reference a font bundled with your theme.

Let’s try an example. Building off the code from the previous section, suppose you wanted to replace the system UI font with the Open Sans web font.

This example will also assume you have downloaded and converted the Open Sans font to the modern `.woff2` format, which is widely supported by most browsers. You’ve also placed these files in your theme’s `/assets/fonts` folder like this:

- `/assets`
    - `/fonts`
        - `/open-sans.woff2`
        - `/open-sans-italic.woff2`

With your web fonts bundled in your theme and ready to go, add this code to your `theme.json` file to register them:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json",
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"typography": {
			"fontFamilies": [
				{
					"name": "Primary",
					"slug": "primary",
					"fontFamily": "Charter, 'Bitstream Charter', 'Sitka Text', Cambria, serif"
				},
				{
					"name": "Secondary",
					"slug": "secondary",
					"fontFamily": "'Open Sans', sans-serif",
					"fontFace": [
						{
							"fontFamily": "Open Sans",
							"fontWeight": "300 800",
							"fontStyle": "normal",
							"fontStretch": "normal",
							"src": [ "file:./assets/fonts/open-sans.woff2" ]
						},
						{
							"fontFamily": "Open Sans",
							"fontWeight": "300 800",
							"fontStyle": "italic",
							"fontStretch": "normal",
							"src": [ "file:./assets/fonts/open-sans-italic.woff2" ]
						}
					]
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

Like with system fonts, WordPress will generate CSS custom properties for web fonts. Here is what the CSS output looks like:

```css
body {
	--wp--preset--font-family--primary: Charter, 'Bitstream Charter', 'Sitka Text', Cambria, serif;
	--wp--preset--font-family--secondary: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
}
```

## Custom font sizes

WordPress lets you register any number of preset font sizes that your theme users can choose from. By registering custom sizes, you can more easily maintain consistent typography across the theme.  
Custom font sizes appear as options in the **Typography &gt; Size** panel in the inspector controls for blocks that support the feature:

[![WordPress post editor showing multiple paragraphs with different font sizes.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/font-sizes.jpg?resize=2048%2C1056&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/font-sizes.jpg?ssl=1)Note that if you have more than five custom sizes, the UI will show a dropdown select instead of the button group shown in the above screenshot.

There are two `theme.json.settings.typography` sub-properties related font sizes:

- **`fluid`:** Whether to enable fluid font sizes that scale up on large screens and down on smaller screens. This can be overridden for individual custom sizes. Defaults to `false`.
- **`fontSizes`:** An array of font size objects that you can use to customize the available presets that users can choose from. WordPress registers the default sizes of `small`, `medium`, `large`, and `x-large`.

Here is what these properties look like in the default WordPress `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"typography": {
			"fluid": false,
			"fontSizes": [
				{
					"name": "Small",
					"slug": "small",
					"size": "13px"
				},
				{
					"name": "Medium",
					"slug": "medium",
					"size": "20px"
				},
				{
					"name": "Large",
					"slug": "large",
					"size": "36px"
				},
				{
					"name": "Extra Large",
					"slug": "x-large",
					"size": "42px"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

As you can see, WordPress disables fluid font sizes by default and registers four static sizes of its own. In almost all cases, you will want to overwrite these with sizes that match your theme’s design.

Like other presets that you can set in `theme.json`, WordPress automatically generates CSS custom properties for font sizes using the `--wp--preset--font-size--{$slug}` format. For the default sizes, this CSS is output in the editor and on the front end:

```css
body {
	--wp--preset--font-size--small: 13px;
	--wp--preset--font-size--medium: 20px;
	--wp--preset--font-size--large: 36px;
	--wp--preset--font-size--x-large: 42px;
}
```

WordPress also generates custom CSS classes for each font size preset using the `.has-{$slug}-font-size` naming scheme. The default sizes produce these classes:

```css
.has-small-font-size{
	font-size: var(--wp--preset--font-size--small) !important;
}

.has-medium-font-size{
	font-size: var(--wp--preset--font-size--medium) !important;
}

.has-large-font-size{
	font-size: var(--wp--preset--font-size--large) !important;
}

.has-x-large-font-size{
	font-size: var(--wp--preset--font-size--x-large) !important;
}
```

### Enabling fluid typography

In modern web design, you will almost always utilize fluid typography. This allows your font sizes to scale up or down with the viewport or container.

WordPress uses a viewport-based system for fluid typography. But you don’t have to rely on this if you prefer to use something different, such as a container-based system, and can leave it disabled.

Suppose you wanted to use the default core sizes but wanted them all to be fluid instead of static values. You can enable this by setting `settings.typography.fluid` to `true` in your `theme.json` file:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"typography": {
			"fluid": true
		}
	}
}
```

WordPress will now generate fluid sizes for registered font sizes:

```css
body {
	--wp--preset--font-size--small: 13px;
	--wp--preset--font-size--medium: clamp(14px, 0.875rem + ((1vw - 3.2px) * 0.852), 20px);
	--wp--preset--font-size--large: clamp(22.041px, 1.378rem + ((1vw - 3.2px) * 1.983), 36px);
	--wp--preset--font-size--x-large: clamp(25.014px, 1.563rem + ((1vw - 3.2px) * 2.413), 42px);
}
```

`14px` is the default minimum font-size limit. Because the `small` size is below that limit, it remained at its static size of `13px`.

### Registering custom font size presets

You will undoubtedly want to register font sizes that match your theme’s design instead of sticking with the defaults. To do this, you must pass an array of font size objects to the `settings.typography.fontSizes` property in `theme.json`.

Each of these objects accepts several properties:

- **`name`:** The human-readable title for the size, which can be translated.
- **`size`:** A valid CSS size. This can be a number and unit, a custom fluid size using `clamp()`, or a reference to another custom CSS property.
- **`slug`:** The slug for the size, which will be appended to a generated CSS custom property: `--wp--preset--spacing--{slug}`.
- **`fluid`:** A boolean value to enable or disable fluid typography for this specific size, overwriting the global property. Alternatively, it can be an object containing: 
    - **`min`:** The minimum value that the font size can scale down to. Must be a valid CSS size.
    - **`max`:** The maximum value that the font size can scale up to. Must be a valid CSS size.

Let’s register a simple set of custom sizes with static values first. Add this code to your `theme.json` file:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json",
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"typography": {
			"fontSizes": [
				{
					"name": "Small",
					"size": "1rem",
					"slug": "sm"
				},
				{
					"name": "Medium",
					"size": "1.25rem",
					"slug": "md"
				},
				{
					"name": "Large",
					"size": "1.5rem",
					"slug": "lg"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

Just like with the default size presets, WordPress will automatically generate the CSS for each in both the editor and on the front end:

```css
body {
	--wp--preset--font-size--sm: 1rem;
	--wp--preset--font-size--md: 1.25rem;
	--wp--preset--font-size--lg: 1.5rem;
}
```

Now, let’s take this one step further. In the previous example, you registered Small, Medium, and Large sizes. Suppose that you wanted the Small size to maintain its value regardless of the browser’s viewport width. But you want the Medium and Large size to scale along with the viewport.

Using the `fluid` property, let’s configure these on a size-by-size basis. Add this code to your `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json",
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"typography": {
			"fluid": true,
			"fontSizes": [
				{
					"name": "Small",
					"size": "1rem",
					"slug": "sm",
					"fluid": false
				},
				{
					"name": "Medium",
					"size": "1.25rem",
					"slug": "md",
					"fluid": {
						"min": "1rem",
						"max": "1.5rem"
					}
				},
				{
					"name": "Large",
					"size": "1.5rem",
					"slug": "lg",
					"fluid": {
						"min": "1.25rem",
						"max": "2rem"
					}
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

WordPress will generate these CSS custom properties:

```css
body {
	--wp--preset--font-size--sm: 1rem;
	--wp--preset--font-size--md: clamp(1rem, 1rem + ((1vw - 0.2rem) * 1.136), 1.5rem);
	--wp--preset--font-size--lg: clamp(1.25rem, 1.25rem + ((1vw - 0.2rem) * 1.705), 2rem);
}
```

There aren’t many limits to how you can customize this for your theme. The above offers an intro to registering custom font sizes, but you have full control over how this works for your theme.

For a deeper understanding of fluid font sizes, read [Intrinsic design, theming, and rethinking how to design with WordPress](#news/2023/02/intrinsic-design-theming-and-rethinking-how-to-design-with-wordpress) on the Developer Blog.

# Use Root Padding Aware Alignments <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/use-root-padding-aware-alignments" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/use-root-padding-aware-alignments/

The `settings.useRootPaddingAwareAlignments` property can be one of the most confusing settings in `theme.json`. It is not tied to an interface option. Nor is it used for registering presets. Instead, it’s for configuring where WordPress places your theme’s horizontal padding styles.

This means it works in conjunction with `styles.spacing.padding` in `theme.json`. You can find out more about general styling in the [Styles documentation](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles), but you’ll learn how this specific style works alongside this setting here.

## What is root padding?

Before understanding how the `settings.useRootPaddingAwareAlignments` property works, you must first understand what root padding is.

Root padding is the padding that is applied to a web page’s “root” element. In the case of WordPress themes, this is the `<body>` element. To customize the spacing for the root element, you must target the `styles.spacing.padding` element in `theme.json`.

Take the following `theme.json` snippet, for example. It adds `0` for top and bottom padding and `2rem` for left and right padding:

```json
{
	"version": 2,	
	"styles": {
		"spacing": {
			"padding": {
				"top": "0",
				"bottom": "0",
				"left": "2rem",
				"right": "2rem"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

By default, this will add `2rem` of padding on the left and right sides of the `<body>` (root) element.

As shown in this screenshot, there is horizontal padding at the root, and a full-width Cover block stretches until it hits that padding:

[![WordPress site header with a Cover block background. It has padding to the left and right of it so that it doesn't stretch the full width of the screen.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/root-padding.jpg?resize=2048%2C1024&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/root-padding.jpg?ssl=1)This is the CSS that WordPress outputs based on the above `theme.json` code:

```css
body {
	padding-top: 0;
	padding-right: 2rem;
	padding-bottom: 0;
	padding-left: 2rem;
}
```

But—and this is where things can look odd to seasoned designers—when `settings.useRootPaddingAwareAlignments` is enabled, the “root” padding is no longer applied to the root element. It is applied to container blocks like Group.

You’ll learn more about why this happens in the next section. The main goal right now is to understand that root padding is traditionally applied to the `<body>` element, and that is what most theme authors would expect.

For root padding aware alignments, WordPress is only concerned with the horizontal (left and right) padding. So the vertical (top and bottom) padding is not relevant to this documentation.

## Enabling root padding aware alignments

By default, WordPress will apply root padding to the `<body>` element. If this makes sense for your theme’s design, you don’t need to do anything else.

*But what if you want to let full-width items stretch to the edges of the screen* ***and*** *have padding on the root element?*

When compared to the first screenshot, notice how the Cover block stretches to edges of the screen but there is padding still applied to the nested blocks here:

[![WordPress site header with a Cover block background that stretches the full width of the screen.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/root-padding-aware.jpg?resize=1024%2C510&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/root-padding-aware.jpg?ssl=1)This is a common design pattern, and there are several ways to stretch elements beyond their containers in CSS. But WordPress has a standard approach that would work with any theme.

That’s where `settings.useRootPaddingAwareAlignments` comes in. When this property is set to `true`, it puts the root padding on container elements instead of `<body>`. This must also be combined with a `styles.spacing.padding` object, particularly with horizontal padding applied.

Try this code in your `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"useRootPaddingAwareAlignments": true
	},	
	"styles": {
		"spacing": {
			"padding": {
				"top": "0",
				"bottom": "0",
				"left": "2rem",
				"right": "2rem"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

There is no right or wrong way to handle root padding. It is a situational setting where you must decide which option is best for your theme’s design.

### How does this work?

It’s not particularly vital to know how WordPress handles all of this under the hood, but sometimes you might just want a deeper understanding of what’s going on.

When you enable `settings.useRootPaddingAwareAlignments`, as shown in the last `theme.json` example, WordPress will generate two new bits of CSS. The first is that it defines some CSS custom properties for the root padding:

```css
body {
	--wp--style--root--padding-top: 0;
	--wp--style--root--padding-right: 2rem;
	--wp--style--root--padding-bottom: 0;
	--wp--style--root--padding-left: 2rem;
}
```

The second is that it adds a `.has-global-padding` class:

```css
.has-global-padding {
	padding-right: var(--wp--style--root--padding-right);
	padding-left: var(--wp--style--root--padding-left);
}
```

This class is then given to container blocks with constrained layouts (for example, Group blocks with the **Layout &gt; Inner blocks use content width** option enabled):

```markup
<div class="wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
	<!-- nested blocks... -->
</div>
```

Beyond that, WordPress adds inline CSS to stretch nested wide and full-width blocks beyond their parent block’s width (including the additional padding that’s added to the width).

# Blocks <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/blocks" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/blocks/

Most settings in `theme.json` let you configure properties at the global level. This means that they apply to all blocks that support them. But WordPress also lets you control this at the block level.

That’s what the `settings.block` property is for—you can configure everything from typography, to colors, to spacing, and more for individual blocks.

Before moving forward with this page of the handbook, it is important to familiarize yourself with at least some of the existing [`theme.json` settings](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings). This way, you can apply them on a per-block basis.

## How block settings work

In the previous pages of the `theme.json` settings documentation, you learned how to configure specific properties at the global level. Essentially, this means that they are applied to all blocks that support the specific property/feature.

You would have configured many of these properties in your `theme.json` (shortened for example—you can review all available properties via the main [settings documentation](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings)):

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"border": {},
		"color": {},
		"custom": {},
		"spacing": {},
		"typography": {}
	}
}
```

But there are times when you need to add settings at the individual block level, and anything set for the block will overrule its global setting. So let’s explore an example that shows block-specific settings overwriting the global settings.

For this example, you will create a custom color palette, which you can learn about in the [color settings documentation](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settingscolor). This will be applied globally and used for every block’s color picker. Then, you will create a custom color palette for the Cover block that’s only shown for the Cover block.

First, add your global color palette in `theme.json` with two colors named `base` and `contrast`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"palette": [
				{
					"color": "#0284c7",
					"name": "Base",
					"slug": "base"
				},
				{
					"color": "#ffffff",
					"name": "Contrast",
					"slug": "contrast"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

Now add a Cover block and some nested text in the WordPress editor, saving the **Text** and **Overlay** colors for the block to your two custom colors:

[![WordPress post editor showing a Cover block with a blue background and white text.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/cover-global-colors.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/cover-global-colors.jpg?ssl=1)As you can see, the Cover block currently uses the global color palette that you configured in your `theme.json` file.

Suppose that you wanted the Cover block to use an orange color palette. You can configure that by targeting `settings.blocks[core/cover].color.palette` in your `theme.json` file and passing an array of custom colors.

Add this new section to your existing `theme.json` so that it looks like this:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"palette": [
				{
					"color": "#0284c7",
					"name": "Base",
					"slug": "base"
				},
				{
					"color": "#ffffff",
					"name": "Contrast",
					"slug": "contrast"
				}
			]
		}
		"blocks": {
			"core/cover": {
				"color": {
					"palette": [
						{
							"color": "#ea580c",
							"name": "Base",
							"slug": "base"
						},
						{
							"color": "#fff7ed",
							"name": "Contrast",
							"slug": "contrast"
						}
					]
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

As shown in the `theme.json` example, you use the same organizational structure for block settings as you do for global settings (i.e., `settings.color` at the global level but `settings.blocks[core/cover].color` at the block level).

If you refresh your browser window, your Cover block should now show the new colors:

[![WordPress post editor showing a Cover block with an orange background and white text.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/cover-block-colors.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/cover-block-colors.jpg?ssl=1)If you check other blocks, they will still use the global color palette. Only the Cover block will use this custom orange palette.

Per-block color palettes are just the tip of the iceberg. You can configure any `theme.json` for any block (assuming the block supports it). This gives you an incredible amount of control over how your theme works.

When targeting a block’s settings, you must know both its namespace and slug. Above, you learned that the Cover block has the namespace (`core`) and slug (`cover`), creating the namespace/slug combination of `core/cover`. All core WordPress blocks have the `core` namespace, and you can find this information for any block (including from third-party plugins) in its `block.json` file.

## Default block settings

Believe it or not, WordPress actually configures a couple of default block settings in `theme.json`. Generally, this would be left to themes, but these settings are primarily enabled for backward compatibility with features from older versions of WordPress.

WordPress enables a few settings for the Button and Pullquote blocks by default. Here is what this looks like in the default `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"blocks": {
			"core/button": {
				"border": {
					"radius": true
				}
			},
			"core/pullquote": {
				"border": {
					"color": true,
					"radius": true,
					"style": true,
					"width": true
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

You can overwrite these block-specific settings in your `theme.json` file just as you learned to do in the previous section of this documentation.

If you are wondering why some of your global settings do not seem to apply to certain blocks, particularly Button and Pullquote, it is likely because they are being set at the block level. You will need to override these in `settings.blocks` in your `theme.json` if you want a different behavior.

# Applying Styles <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles/applying-styles" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles/applying-styles/

Traditionally, theme authors would style everything from a stylesheet—and they still sometimes must. In modern WordPress, you can also style most, if not all, of your theme directly from your `theme.json` file.

When you use this standard system, it is also reflected in the **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Styles** interface. This means your theme’s users with access to that admin screen can also make changes that easily work alongside your theme’s styles. But it also means that you can design your theme directly from this visual interface if you choose to do so.

`theme.json` supports styles at three different levels:

- Root (global)
- Elements
- Blocks

In this document, you will learn the syntax necessary for styling each of these things via JSON.

## Styling the root element

When referring to the “root” element in WordPress themes, we’re specifically talking about the HTML `<body>` tag. It’s the root of the visual output for the page.

Technically, when styling the root element, you are adding *global* styles that trickle down through the design and are used unless a more specific element or block style overrides them. For example, you’ll likely want to set a default font-family or font-size that is used across the entire design. But you’ll, of course, want to change that in specific instances.

Because these are global styles, it means that they belong directly under the `styles` property.

So let’s add a default text and background color to show how this works:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"styles": {
		"color": {
			"text": "#000000",
			"background": "#f5f1ea"
		}
	}
}
```

As you can see, the `color` property is nested directly beneath the `styles` property. This means that the `text` and `background` colors are applied directly to the `<body>` element by WordPress, resulting in this CSS in the editor and on the front end:

```css
body {
	background: #f5f1ea;
	color: #000000;
}
```

And because of the way the *cascade* works in CSS, these colors will be used for everything, unless a more specific style rule overwrites it.

If you open your site on the front end or via **Appearance &gt; Editor** in the WordPress admin, you should see your colors applied:

[![WordPress Site Editor with Styles interface open, showing the theme's colors.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/styles-root-colors.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/styles-root-colors.jpg?ssl=1)You are not just limited to colors. You can add `typography`, `spacing`, and more here. The root element supports almost all of the available style properties, which you can reference in the [Supported Styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles/styles-reference) documentation.

The `styles.spacing.padding` property has a unique use case when used in conjunction with `settings.useRootPaddingAwareAlignments`. For more information on how these two work together, read the [Use Root Padding Aware Alignments](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/use-root-padding-aware-alignments) documentation.

## Styling elements

WordPress has a standard system for styling elements via `theme.json`. In this case, “elements” usually maps to actual HTML elements. But there are cases where it’s referring to something that doesn’t map directly to a single HTML element. In general, these should be reasonably straightforward.

Just like styling the root element and blocks, which you’ll learn about below, you can apply a wide range of the [supported styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles/styles-reference) to elements.

The currently-supported elements are:

- **`button`:** Applied to `<button>` elements and button-like links, such as that used for the Button block.
- **`caption`:** Applied to media captions, which are wrapped in a `<figcaption>` element.
- **`cite`:** Applied to the `<cite>` element when used for citations, such as that used for the Quote and Pullquote blocks.
- **`heading`:** Applied to all heading elements from `<h1>` through `<h6>`, but these can be overridden for individual headings.
- **`h1 - h6`:** Each of the `<h1>` through `<h6>` elements can be individually styled.
- **`link`:** Applied to the `<a>` tag, which is used to create links.

Let’s try a real example now. Suppose you wanted to give all buttons across the site a white text color that sits atop a red background. You need to target the `text` and `background` properties of `styles.elements.button.color`.

Add this code to your `theme.json` file:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"styles": {
		"elements": {
			"button": {
				"color": {
					"text": "#ffffff",
					"background": "#aa3f33"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

If you view a button in the Site Editor or on the front end of the site, you should see these colors applied:

[![WordPress Style Book with the Buttons block highlighted and the Text color option expanded.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/styles-elements-button.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/styles-elements-button.jpg?ssl=1)

Some elements both serve as element styles and the foundation of more specific blocks. In the case of elements that also tie into blocks, the block styles will overrule the element styles. For example, the Button and Heading blocks can have their own styles but they will fall back to the `button` and `heading` element styles.

WordPress will generate this CSS in both the editor and on the front end for your `button` element styles:

```css
.wp-element-button, 
.wp-block-button__link {
	background-color: #aa3f33;
	color: #ffffff;
}
```

WordPress sometimes—but not always—gives elements a specific CSS class with the naming scheme of `.wp-element-{$element}`. For example, button elements have the `.wp-element-button` class. The styles you provide via `theme.json` are then applied to that CSS class.

As you can see in the generated CSS, WordPress is targeting the `.wp-element-button` class when styling the `button` element. But it’s also specifically targeting the `.wp-block-button__link` class for backward compatibility with the Button block.

### Styling pseudo-classes

You can also add style properties for a standard set of CSS pseudo-classes for some elements. Generally, this will be for features like link hover and focus styles.

The `button` and `link` elements support these pseudo-classes:

- `:hover`
- `:focus`
- `:active`
- `:visited`

Each pseudo-class must be added as a property nested under the element you want to style. For example, you must target `styles.elements.link.:hover` to customize link hover styles.

Let’s look at this in context using the previous example of styling `button` elements. Suppose you wanted to change the background color when a user’s mouse hovers over buttons. Use this `theme.json` code to achieve that:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"styles": {
		"elements": {
			"button": {
				"color": {
					"text": "#ffffff",
					"background": "#aa3f33"
				},
				":hover": {
					"color": {
						"background": "#822f27"
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Styling blocks

One of the great things about the block system is that it provides a standardized system for styling any block. This means that you can add styles for core WordPress blocks as well as third-party plugin blocks directly in `theme.json`.

To style a specific block, you must target `styles.blocks.blockname` in your `theme.json` file. From there, you can add any of the block’s [supported styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles/styles-reference).

Let’s take a look at a basic example. Assume that you want to give a slightly rounded border to all Image blocks. For this, you need to target the `border.radius` property.

Add this code to your `theme.json` file:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"styles": {
		"blocks": {
			"core/image": {
				"border": {
					"radius": "6px"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

This should make any instance of the Image block on your site appear with a rounded border:

[![WordPress Style book with the Image block highlighted.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/styles-blocks-image.jpg?resize=2048%2C1056&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/styles-blocks-image.jpg?ssl=1)WordPress will also generate this CSS for the nested `<img>` element within the Image block for both the editor and front end:

```css
.wp-block-image img {
	border-radius: 6px;
}
```

You can add styles for as many or as few blocks as you want. That’s entirely up to you and what you want to accomplish with your design. Have fun with it!

For a full list of core WordPress blocks that you can style, visit the [Core Blocks Reference](#block-editor/reference-guides/core-blocks). Note that this does not include blocks from plugins and other third-party sources.

When targeting a block’s styles, you must know both its namespace and slug. Above, you learned that the Image block has the namespace (`core`) and slug (`image`), creating the namespace/slug combination of `core/image`. All core WordPress blocks have the `core` namespace, and you can find this information for any block (including from third-party plugins) in its `block.json` file.

### Styling elements nested in blocks

You can also add custom styles for elements that are nested within blocks. This feature gives you a lot of flexibility for contextually styling elements directly within `theme.json`.

When styling a block’s nested elements, you must pass an `elements` object directly under the block property: `styles.blocks.blockname.elements`.

Suppose you wanted a large font size for the PullQuote block but you wanted to create a fluid size for its nested `<cite>` element that never grew larger than `50%` of the parent block or `1.5rem`, whichever is the larger of the two.

For this, you need to define the `typography.fontSize` for both the `core/pullquote` block and its nested `cite` element in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"styles": {
		"elements": {
			"core/pullquote": {
				"typography": {
					"fontSize": "2.25rem"
				},
				"elements": {
					"cite": {
						"typography": {
							"fontSize": "max( 50%, 1.5rem )"
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The font-size will now look like this in the editor:

[![WordPress post editor with a Pullquote block and nested cite element.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/styles-block-element-cite.jpg?resize=2048%2C1056&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/styles-block-element-cite.jpg?ssl=1)WordPress generates this CSS for styling both the Pullquote block and its nested `<cite>` element:

```css
.wp-block-pullquote {
	font-size: 2.25rem;
}

.wp-block-pullquote cite {
	font-size: max( 50%, 1.5rem );
}
```

### Styling block style variations (block styles)

Since WordPress 6.2, you can customize the core block style variations (i.e., block styles) via `theme.json`. This feature allows you to use [supported styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles/styles-reference) without having to write custom CSS in a separate stylesheet.

To customize a block style variation, you must add a nested `variations` property within the block you want to style in `theme.json`. Then, each variation can use any of the block’s supported styles.

Let’s walk through an example of modifying the Button block’s Outline style variation. Suppose you wanted to define the border color, style, and width that is specific to this block style variation.

Add this code to your `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"styles": {
		"blocks": {
			"core/button": {
				"variations": {
					"outline": {
						"border": {
							"color": "currentColor",
							"style": "solid",
							"width": "2px"
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

You should now see these changes reflected in the editor when the Outline block style variation is selected for the Button block:

[![WordPress post editor with four Button blocks in a 2x2 grid. Two of the buttons have a filled background, and the other two are outlined.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/styles-block-variations-button.jpg?resize=2048%2C1056&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/styles-block-variations-button.jpg?ssl=1)The currently available blocks and their core WordPress style variations are:

- **`core/button`:** `outline`, `fill`
- **`core/image`:** `rounded`
- **`core/quote`:** `plain`
- **`core/site-logo`:** `rounded`
- **`core/separator`:** `wide`, `dots`
- **`core/social-links`:** `logos-only`, `pill-shape`
- **`core/table`:** `stripes`

# Using Presets <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles/using-presets" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles/using-presets/

In the `theme.json` [Settings documentation](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings), you learned how to register custom presets, such as a color palette, font sizes, a spacing scale, and more. In the [Styles documentation](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles), you’ve learned how to apply CSS styles via `theme.json`.

Now it’s time to combine these two concepts by applying styles using the presets that you’ve registered.

In the styles documentation, you will often see examples using hard-coded CSS values. This is primarily for the sake of demonstration. You will almost always use registered presets instead. This makes it much easier to manage everything from a single location.

## What are presets?

Essentially, presets are options that you register—generally for users to select from the UI—that map to CSS custom properties.

For example, when you learned how to [register custom font sizes](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/typography/), you added your presets to `settings.typography.fontSizes`. WordPress takes each of those font sizes and creates a CSS custom property with the name of `--wp--preset--font-size–{$slug}`.

WordPress itself, your theme, plugins, and even users can register presets for the various features that are supported. And WordPress creates CSS custom properties for all registered presets with the name of `--wp--preset–{$feature}-{$slug}`.

Let’s look at a basic example of a [custom color palette](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/color/) with three colors:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"palette": [
				{
					"color": "#ffffff",
					"name": "Base",
					"slug": "base"
				},
				{
					"color": "#000000",
					"name": "Contrast",
					"slug": "contrast"
				},
				{
					"color": "#89cff0",
					"name": "Primary",
					"slug": "primary"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

This creates three CSS custom properties, which WordPress will output in the editor and on the front end:

```css
body {
	--wp--preset--color--base: #ffffff;
	--wp--preset--color--contrast: #000000;
	--wp--preset--color--primary: #89cff0;
}
```

At the end of the day, presets are merely a standardized method of creating options in the interface and generating CSS custom properties.

## Applying presets as styles

Because presets are registered as settings, they are available to select in the user interface. But you must apply them as styles if you want to use them as part of your theme’s default design.

Let’s build off the custom color palette from the previous section. Suppose you wanted to apply these styles using your registered presets:

- The site’s background color should use the `base` preset.
- The site’s primary text color should use the `contrast` preset.
- Link colors should use the `primary` preset.

To reference presets in `theme.json`, there is a special syntax that you can use: `var:preset|$feature|$slug`. So `base` color in this instance would be `var:preset|color|base`.

With that plan in mind and using what you’ve already learned from this chapter, try your hand at recreating this in `theme.json`. Your code should look like this:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"color": {
			"palette": [
				{
					"color": "#ffffff",
					"name": "Base",
					"slug": "base"
				},
				{
					"color": "#000000",
					"name": "Contrast",
					"slug": "contrast"
				},
				{
					"color": "#89cff0",
					"name": "Primary",
					"slug": "primary"
				}
			]
		}
	},
	"styles": {
		"color": {
			"text": "var:preset|color|contrast",
			"background": "var:preset|color|base"
		},
		"elements": {
			"link": {
				"color": {
					"text": "var:preset|color|primary"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

If you test your site on the front end or via the editor, you should see that your colors have correctly applied:

[![WordPress post editor with a couple of demo paragraphs. The image reflects the black text color and blue link color.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/using-presets-color.jpg?resize=2048%2C1056&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/using-presets-color.jpg?ssl=1)The next step now is to figure out which elements and blocks you want to apply other presets to. Depending on the complexity of your theme, this can be as simple as a few custom colors to hundreds of lines of JSON code. Really, what you do from here is entirely up to you.

Technically, you can reference presets using the CSS syntax of `var( --wp--preset--{$feature}--{$slug} )`. But the WordPress `var:preset|$feature|$slug` syntax works much better and always appears correctly throughout the interface in the WordPress admin. Save the CSS syntax for when you are actually writing CSS.

### Referencing custom presets

In the [Custom Settings](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/custom/) documentation, you learned how to create “custom” presets. These are non-standard CSS custom properties that you can register, and WordPress generates the CSS output for you.

These use a different naming convention in comparison to standard presets. Essentially, whenever you used the term `preset` in your code for standard presets, you would exchange that for `custom` when dealing with custom presets.

Let’s walk through an example. Assume that you wanted to register some CSS custom properties for handling line heights in your theme design. You would add this to your `theme.json` file:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"custom": {
			"lineHeight": {
				"xs": "1",
				"sm": "1.25",
				"md": "1.5",
				"lg": "1.75"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

WordPress will generate these custom line heights as CSS custom properties in the editor and on the front end:

```css
body {
	--wp--custom--line-height--xs: 1;
	--wp--custom--line-height--sm: 1.25;
	--wp--custom--line-height--md: 1.5;
	--wp--custom--line-height--lg: 1.75;
}
```

To reference these as styles in `theme.json`, you would use the `var:custom` syntax instead of `var:preset`.

Suppose you wanted to apply the registered `md` line-height size as the default line height at the root/global level. For that, you would need to target `styles.typography.lineHeight`.

Here is what the full code would look like in `theme.json`:

```
{
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"custom": {
			"lineHeight": {
				"xs": "1",
				"sm": "1.25",
				"md": "1.5",
				"lg": "1.75"
			}
		}
	},
	"styles": {
		"typography": {
			"lineHeight": "var:custom|line-height|md"
		}
	}
}
```

Of course, you could use your other custom line-height presets for styling other elements and blocks.

## Available presets

WordPress has several features that you can register presets for. You can find these presets in their corresponding settings docs (the specific properties are noted in parentheses):

- [Color](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/color/) (`palette`)
- [Shadow](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/shadow/) (`presets`)
- [Spacing](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/spacing/) (`spacingScale`, `spacingSizes`)
- [Typography](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/typography/) (`fontSizes`, `fontFamily`)
- [Custom](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/custom/)

# Styles Reference <a name="themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles/styles-reference" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles/styles-reference/

This is a reference to the available style properties that you can apply to the root element (global), individual elements, and individual blocks in `theme.json`. Please review the [Applying Styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles/applying-styles) documentation to learn how to apply styles to your theme.

## Border

There are two methods for working with the `border` style property. The first is to target all sides of a block or element with the properties shown in the table:

| Property | Type | CSS Property |
|---|---|---|
| `border.radius` | string, object | [`border-radius`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius) |
| `border.color` | string, object | [`border-color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-color) |
| `border.style` | string, object | [`border-style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-style) |
| `border.width` | string, object | [`border-width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-width) |

Example usage in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"styles": {
		"border": {
			"color": "#000000",
			"style": "solid",
			"width": "1px"
		}
	}
}
```

The second method is to specifically target the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` sides:

| Property | Type | CSS Property |
|---|---|---|
| `border.<side>.color` | string, object | `border-<side>-color` |
| `border.<side>.style` | string, object | `border-<side>-style` |
| `border.<side>.width` | string, object | `border-<side>-width` |

Example usage in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"styles": {
		"border": {
			"top": {
				"color": "#000000",
				"style": "solid",
				"width": "1px"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Color

The `color` style property lets you define the default text, background, and link colors for a block or element:

| `color.background-color` | string, object | [`background-color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) |
| `color.link` | string, object | [`color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color) (applied to nested `<a>` elements) |

Example usage in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"styles": {
		"blocks": {
			"core/group": {
				"color": {
					"text": "#000000",
					"background": "#ffffff",
					"link": "#777777"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Dimensions

The `dimensions` style property lets you define the minimum height for a block or element:

| Property | Type | CSS Property |
|---|---|---|
| `dimensions.minHeight` | string, object | [`min-height`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-height) |

Example usage in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"styles": {
		"blocks": {
			"core/cover": {
				"dimensions": {
					"minHeight": "50vh"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Filter

The `filter` style property lets you define filters for a block or element. Currently, you can set a default duotone filter:

				"filter": {
					"duotone": "var(--wp--preset--duotone--default-filter)"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Shadow

The `shadow` style property lets you define the default box-shadow style for a block or element:

| Property | Type | CSS Property |
|---|---|---|
| `shadow` | string, object | [`box-shadow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) |

Example usage in `theme.json`:

		"blocks": {
			"core/heading": {
				"shadow": "0 1px 2px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05)"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Spacing

The `spacing` style property lets you define the default gap, margin, and padding for a block or element:

| Property | Type | CSS Property |
|---|---|---|
| `blockGap` | string, object | [`margin-top`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-top), [`gap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gap) |
| `margin.<side>` | string, object | [`margin-<side>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) |
| `padding.<side>` | string, object | [`padding-<side>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding) |

You can define any or all of the sides (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`) for the `margin` and `padding` style properties.

Example usage in `theme.json`:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"styles": {
		"spacing": {
			"blockGap": "2rem",
			"margin": {
				"top": "2rem",
				"bottom": "2rem"
			},
			"padding": {
				"left": "2rem",
				"right": "2rem"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Typography

The `typography` style property lets you define default font and text-related styles for a block or element:

# Templates <a name="themes/templates" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/templates/

Welcome to the Templates documentation. In this chapter you will learn how the WordPress block template system works, how to build custom templates and parts, and include them in your theme.

Templates are one of the core concepts of building websites, representing the underlying structure that presents your content in the browser. In many ways, they are the most important feature of developing WordPress themes.

## Navigating this chapter

Use the below links to find the topic you are looking for in this chapter. Each section of the chapter is set up to offer a straightforward learning path toward learning how to build templates for those building their first theme. But if you are already familiar with the foundational concepts, feel free to skip ahead to the topic you want to learn more about.

# Introduction to Templates <a name="themes/templates/introduction-to-templates" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/templates/introduction-to-templates/

Like nearly all content management systems, WordPress uses a templating system to handle the output of content on the front end of a website. In modern block themes, templates are HTML files with [block markup](#block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts).

In this document, you will learn how the templating system in WordPress works. After that, you can jump ahead to the more detailed [Templates](#themes/templates/templates) and [Template Parts](#themes/templates/template-parts) documentation.

## What are templates?

In a nutshell, templates take dynamic data and wrap it into structured HTML markup, which is then sent to the browser. It is not a particularly revolutionary concept, and it is one that nearly every website system with dynamic data uses.

 The templating system in WordPress does a few important things:

- Parses block markup, which is used to reference static and dynamic data.
- Retrieves dynamic data (e.g., post content, site options, etc.) from the database.
- Sends the resulting HTML to the visitor’s browser.

The major difference between WordPress and most other platforms is the inclusion of block markup. Block theme templates are made entirely of blocks, which can both represent static or dynamic data. The WordPress templating system parses these blocks to ensure they output the correct content when it is sent to the visitor’s browser.

Another thing that WordPress does well is provide a visual interface to build or customize templates directly from the admin:

[![WordPress Site Editor with the Templates section open, showing the site's homepage.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/templates-interface.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/templates-interface.jpg?ssl=1)The Site Editor also lets your theme’s users overwrite your block templates and parts from within the administration interface. Any changes that users make are saved in their site’s database. These customizations are stored the same way in the database as they are in template files: as block markup.

### Templates vs. plain HTML

If you’ve already learned some basic HTML, you’ve probably built out a webpage or two. But it can be very hard to build out a full website with HTML because you must constantly update every file anytime you make a global change across the entire site.

This is because HTML is a document language. It does not know how to handle dynamic data, nor can it be used to dynamically load reusable pieces of code.

Technically, block templates are `.html` files. However, they contain specialized block markup that is parsed by WordPress’ templating system, which is built in PHP (on the front end) and JavaScript (in the editor). Using this system, blocks can be dynamic, despite existing within `.html` files.

#### Dynamic data

The major difference between a template and writing plain HTML files is that templates have the ability to insert dynamic data. Let’s look at an example of what this would look like if you were building your website from scratch and not using a CMS like WordPress.

Suppose you wanted to output your site title in plain HTML. You would traditionally wrap it in an `<h1>` tag and manually type your site name:

```markup
<h1>Your Website Name</h1>
```

With WordPress, you don’t need to know the correct HTML or the name of the site. Because a theme can be used on any WordPress site, the site title is dynamic data that will be different from one site to the next.

To output the correct site title and its associated HTML in a block theme, you add the block markup instead:

```markup
<!-- wp:site-title /-->
```

By using the block markup, your theme will work anywhere WordPress is installed.

#### Reusability

One of the principles of good web design is DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). When building websites with plain HTML, you must recode all of that HTML for every single page of the site.

For example, most website headers and footers are exactly the same across every page of the site. So it doesn’t make sense to repeat that code for every page. A template system lets you write the code once and reuse it everywhere.

In WordPress, these smaller, reusable sections of a template are called template parts (or simply, parts).

If you were to create a template part named `header.html`, you could include it using the correct block markup in any template:

```markup
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header","tagName":"header"} /-->
```

This lets you reuse the header part in all of your templates, but you only need to create the `header.html` file once.

## Block markup

Templates and template parts are files that are made entirely of block markup that represents individual blocks and their settings. WordPress parses this block markup and translates it to its final HTML markup, which can be understood by web browsers.

Unlike [classic themes](#themes/classic-themes), WordPress automatically outputs some standard HTML elements for block themes. This includes the wrapping `<html>` and `<body>` tags, `<head>`, and an outer `<div class="wp-site-blocks">`. WordPress and plugins also automatically output meta, styles, and scripts. In comparison to classic themes, block themes are not responsible for adding PHP hooks.

Block markup is technically valid HTML. WordPress uses a custom HTML comment syntax with a standardized format for the markup.

Let’s take a look at a fictional block’s markup in a template:

```markup
<!-- wp:namespace/slug {"align":"full"} /-->
```

As you can see, the code is wrapped with an opening `\<!--` and closing `/-->` HTML comment tag. This tells WordPress to look for block markup. The markup can then be broken down into a four parts:

- **Prefix:** The `wp:` prefix tells WordPress that this is a block that needs to be parsed and not just an ordinary HTML comment. This is necessary for core and third-party blocks.
- **Namespace:** The namespace for the block to parse.
- **Slug:** The slug for the block to parse.
- **Block Settings:** Valid JSON code that represents the block’s settings.

When working with core WordPress blocks, you do not use the block namespace. For example, the `core/site-title` block doesn’t include the preceding `core/` when called:

```markup
<!-- wp:site-title /-->
```

References to third-party blocks must include the namespace.

### How to create block markup

You could certainly learn to manually write all of the block markup for your theme by hand. But it can be tough to remember all of the possible block settings, and it is also easy to make an error, resulting in a broken website.

Instead, when building block templates, you will almost always want to build via the block editor and either save directly in the database or copy the block markup into your theme’s template files.

The easiest way to build an entire template is to do so via **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Templates** in the WordPress admin. Here is a look at the Twenty Twenty-Three’s **Home** template from that screen:

[![Home template in the Site Editor, which shows a three-column grid of posts.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/templates-tt3-home.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/templates-tt3-home.jpg?ssl=1)You can customize the template entirely using the visual Site Editor by adding, moving, or deleting blocks. You can also adjust individual block settings.

Once your template is designed just like you want, you click the **Options** button (**⋮** icon) in the toolbar and select the **Code Editor** option. This will give you the block markup for your template. From there, copy and paste it into your template file:

[![Code view of the Home template code in the Site Editor.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/template-code-view.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/template-code-view.jpg?ssl=1)In the case of the Home template, you would paste the block markup in the `/templates/home.html` template of your theme.

Of course, you only need to do this if you plan on distributing the theme to other people. If this is your own site, you can save the template from that screen, and it will be saved to the database, overwriting the `/templates/home.html` template file.

Another technique that some theme authors employ is to build from either the Post/Page Editor or Template Editor. Sometimes, they will create certain smaller sections to copy and paste directly into their templates or template parts.

To copy blocks from the Post Editor, select the blocks that you want to use and click the **Options** button (**⋮** icon) from the block-editing toolbar. Then click the **Copy** button from the dropdown:

[![WordPress post editor showing a row of buttons. A dropdown menu from the toolbar is open with the Copy command highlighted.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/copy-blocks.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/copy-blocks.jpg?ssl=1)From there, you can paste the copied code into your template or template part file. You can also switch to the **Code Editor** mode from this screen just like in the Site Editor and copy block markup in the same way.

## The relationship between templates and parts

Templates represent the overall HTML output that gets sent to the browser. An easy way to think of these is as “top-level templates” because they are the top, outermost level of the template system.

Template parts are partial templates that live within top-level templates. Parts make it easy to include reusable sections without having to recreate the block markup for each of the templates.

In your theme, your templates and template parts will be located in the `/templates` and `/parts` folders, respectively. Here is example of what that structure may look like:

- `parts/`
    - `footer.html`
    - `header.html`
- `templates/`
    - `404.html`
    - `archive.html`
    - `index.html` (required)
    - `singular.html`

Let’s look at an example of an archive template (`archive.html`) and its block markup:

```markup
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header","tagName":"header"} /-->

<!-- wp:group {"tagName":"main","layout":{"type":"constrained"}} -->
<main class="wp-block-group">
	<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"loop","align":"full"} /-->
</main>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer","tagName":"footer"} /-->
```

This template basically behaves as a wrapper that includes three template parts:

- `/parts/header.html`
- `/parts/loop.html`
- `/parts/footer.html`

This is not the technique that all block themes use, but it is a common practice. Whenever you have code that is repeated across multiple templates, it’s generally a good idea to copy that code into a template part file and include it in your top-level templates.

At this point, you’ve only been learning about templates at an overarching high level. Now it’s time to dive more deeply into the templating system and how each piece of it works. For your next steps, follow along with these docs:

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/templates/templates/

Templates are one of the most important aspects of theme development. They are files that you put together to represent the document structure that appears on the front end of a website. When combined with [Global Settings and Styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles) (`theme.json`), you can ultimately create a unique design to use for yourself, clients, or just share with the world.

Templates are how you decide where things are placed within your theme.

*Want a giant footer at the bottom of the site?* You can do that by adding specific blocks inside a Group block at the bottom of a template.

*Want a sidebar next to the content area?* No problem. You can put a Columns block in one or more of your templates to create that layout.

In [Introduction to Templates](#themes/templates/introduction-to-templates), you gained a broad overview of how the WordPress templating system works. In this document, we’ll dive more deeply into the templates themselves.

## How do templates work?

Whenever someone visits any page on your site, WordPress takes a look at the URL, runs some logic under the hood, and figures out what type of page the visitor is looking at. That’s a very simplified explanation of it anyway. For theme development, you don’t need to know *how* this part of the process works too deeply—just what the end result is.

Once WordPress determines the type of page, it runs through its “template loader,” which searches for a template that matches the page type. It does this by attempting to locate templates within the template hierarchy for the page type, which is covered in detail in the [Template Hierarchy](#themes/templates/template-hierarchy) documentation.

WordPress will search for templates in the hierarchy in order of priority. If it finds a match in any of these locations, it will stop searching through the hierarchy:

- User-saved template in the database.
- Template in a child theme’s `/templates` folder (if child theme is active).
- Template in the theme’s `/templates` folder.

Once a template is found that matches the page type within the hierarchy, the template is loaded. Its block markup is then parsed and WordPress outputs the resulting HTML markup for the browser to use.

## What’s in a template?

Block theme templates are composed entirely of block markup. That’s it. *Really.*

OK. It’s slightly more nuanced than that. You will generally see these things in block templates:

- Block markup
- References to template parts
- References to block patterns

Ultimately, each of those things is still block markup.

Here’s a look at the `/templates/404.html` template file, which includes all three things:

```markup
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header","tagName":"header"} /-->

<!-- wp:group {"tagName":"main","layout":{"type":"constrained"}} -->
<main class="wp-block-group">
	<!-- wp:pattern {"slug":"twentytwentythree/hidden-404"} /-->
</main>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer","tagName":"footer"} /-->
```

Of course, block templates can be much more complex than that. The point is that block templates must consist entirely of block markup for WordPress to correctly parse the code and output it for the browser.

For a more in-depth look at the architecture of a block, check out the [Key Concepts](#block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts) documentation in the Block Editor Handbook.

## Organizing templates

With block themes, there is only one location that you can put block templates: in the theme’s `/templates` folder. It should be structured like this:

- `templates/`
    - `404.html`
    - `archive.html`
    - `author.html`
    - `home.html`
    - `index.html` (required)
    - `page.html`
    - `singular.html`

The minimum required template file is `index.html`. The existence of this file is how WordPress determines that the theme is a block theme.

Outside of that, you can include as many or as few templates as you need to achieve your theme design.

Technically, WordPress will also look in the `/block-templates` folder if it exists in your theme. This is for backward compatibility with an older version of WordPress. But it is recommended to always use the `/templates` folder instead.

## Building templates

While you can technically type all of the block markup for your templates in your template files, that is not what the typical experience will be when working with block themes. In most cases, you will be working from a visual interface and migrating your block code to your template files.

To explore working with the visual interface, read the support guides on using the Site and Template Editors:

- [Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/)
- [Template Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/)
    - [How to edit templates via the Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/#how-to-edit-templates-via-the-site-editor)
    - [How to use the Template Editor via the WordPress Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/#how-to-edit-templates-via-the-post-editor)

### Editing templates

To access templates from the WordPress admin, open the **Appearance &gt; Editor** menu in the admin menu. Then click the **Templates** item in the sidebar:

[![WordPress Templates interface in the Site Editor, which shows the template options on the left and preview panel on the right.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/templates-site-editor.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/templates-site-editor.jpg?ssl=1)This screen lists all of the existing templates for the site, which can come from three locations:

- User-created templates saved in the database
- Templates from the theme’s `/templates` folder
- Templates dynamically added by plugins

From there, you can make customizations to the existing templates, adjusting blocks to your liking.

Remember that if you save these, they will be stored in the database and will overrule any templates in your theme. If you plan to distribute this theme to others or use it on another site, you must copy the block markup to the matching template in your `/templates` folder as described in [Introduction to Templates](#themes/templates/introduction-to-templates).

### Adding new templates

You can create a new template by clicking the **Add New Template** (**+** icon next to **Templates** heading). This will create a modal overlay as shown here:

[![WordPress Add Template modal overlaid the Site Editor.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/image.png?resize=1600%2C837&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/image.png?ssl=1)From there, you will be able to create an entirely custom template (if it doesn’t already exist for editing).

Again, any new templates you add via the editor are saved in the database. You must create the template file inside your `/templates` folder and copy the block markup to it if you intend to distribute your theme. Be sure that your template filename matches a valid filename in the [Template Hierarchy](#themes/templates/template-hierarchy) (for example, the Home template filename is `home.html`).

### Custom templates

Custom templates are templates that you can assign to individual posts, pages, or entries of a custom post type. They are used for the single post view on the front end of the site.

You or your theme users can select custom templates from the **Template** setting in the **Post/Page** panel in the post editor sidebar:

[![WordPress post editor with the Template option open in the sidebar. The Blank template option is highlighted.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/post-template.jpg?resize=2048%2C1068&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/post-template.jpg?ssl=1)This can be a powerful feature that lets you create unique designs for specific circumstances. For example, you could add something as simple as a different layout with a contact form or something as complex as a news-magazine layout with multiple post queries and other sections.

When adding a new template from the **Templates** screen, you can also create a custom template. From the **Add Template** overlay, there is an option named **Custom Template**. By clicking it, you will add a new custom template within your site’s database.

But to distribute your template with your theme, you must add it to a custom template file in your theme’s `/templates` folder.

The great thing about custom templates is that the filename can be anything you want it to be. Just be sure to avoid using the name of a standard template filename from the [Template Hierarchy](#themes/templates/template-hierarchy), so make sure it’s unique.

Because custom templates can be anything, there are no exact rules on what block markup should be included in them. But if you want to display the post or page content, make sure that you’re using the Post Content block somewhere within it.

The only other rule is that you must register your template via your `theme.json` file. How to do this is covered in the [Custom Templates](#themes/global-settings-and-stylescustom-templates/) documentation under the [Global Settings and Styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles) chapter.

Originally, custom templates were called “page templates.” This is because the feature only worked for pages in the initial implementation. Eventually, posts and other custom post types could use the feature, so it was rebranded to “custom templates.” But you may see these referred to as page templates in other documentation or on third-party sites.

# Template Hierarchy <a name="themes/templates/template-hierarchy" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/templates/template-hierarchy/

As covered in the [Templates](#themes/templates/templates) documentation, templates are reusable files that are used to generate the document structure of pages on your WordPress site. WordPress’ template loader determines which template file should be loaded on any given URL.

This document explains how WordPress’ template loader uses the queried information for a page to build a template hierarchy. Then it covers what the valid templates are for the hierarchy.

## Overview

When a visitor lands on any page on a WordPress site, WordPress uses the [query string](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-glossary/#query-string) to decide which template should be used to display the page. The query string contains data from the URL that helps make this determination.

With this data available, WordPress searches through the template hierarchy until it finds a matching template file. There are generally three potential areas that WordPress might look for a block template within the hierarchy (in order of priority):

- User-created templates stored under the `wp_template` post type in the database.
- Templates located in a child theme’s `/templates` folder (if child theme is active).
- Templates in the theme’s `/templates` folder.

Your theme can package as many or as few templates as needed to achieve your theme design. The `index.html` template is the only required template file for a block theme.

## Visual overview

This diagram shows which template files are called to generate a WordPress page based on the template hierarchy:

[![Visual diagram of the WordPress template hierarchy.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/template-hierarchy-scaled.jpeg?resize=2560%2C1404&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/template-hierarchy-scaled.jpeg?ssl=1)## The template hierarchy by query type

In WordPress, there is not technically a single template hierarchy. It’s best to think of the hierarchy by the type of page being queried. For example, if the front page is being queried, then it will use the front page template hierarchy.

Below, you will find each template hierarchy broken down by its query type (and some subtypes). This will help you determine which template files to include in your theme.

### Front page hierarchy

The Front Page template hierarchy is unique among templates and can change drastically based on what the user has chosen for their **Front page displays** setting under **Settings &gt; Reading** in the admin.

If **Your latest posts** is chosen for the **Front page displays** setting, the hierarchy is:

- `front-page.html`
- Falls back to the [Home template hierarchy](#home-hierarchy)

If **A static page** is chosen for the **Front page displays** setting, the hierarchy is:

- `front-page.html`
- Falls back to the [Page template hierarchy](#page-hierarchy)

Keep in mind that the `front-page.html` template always takes precedence, regardless of the **Front page displays** setting. It is only the templates lower in the hierarchy that are affected by it.

### Home hierarchy

Despite its name, the Home template is not always used for the homepage of a site. Technically, it refers to the page where your latest blog posts are shown (i.e., the blog posts index).

Like the Front Page template hierarchy, the Home template also depends on the **Front page displays** setting under **Settings &gt; Reading** in the admin.

If **Your latest posts** is chosen for the **Front page displays** setting, this hierarchy will be applied to the front page of the site:

- `front-page.html`
- `home.html`
- `index.html`

If **A static page** is chosen for the **Front page displays** setting and a page is selected for **Posts page** setting, the Home template hierarchy applies to the selected posts page (it does not apply to the front page in this case). The hierarchy in this scenario is:

- `home.html`
- `index.html`

**Some history:** The term “home” goes back to WordPress’ earliest days when it was only a blogging system and the only thing that appeared on the site’s front page was blog posts. While WordPress has evolved to allow anything on the front page, the “home” terminology was retained to refer to the blog posts index. And the “front page” terminology was used to refer to the site’s front page.

### Singular hierarchy

When a visitor lands on a single post, page, attachment page, or entry from a custom post type, WordPress attempts to locate a template based on the queried post for that view.

All singular templates can utilize a custom template, which you’ll see listed as `{custom_template}.html` in the sub-sections below. These almost always sit at the top of the hierarchy. For more information on creating custom templates, check out the “Custom Templates” section of the main [Templates](#themes/templates/templates) documentation.

#### Single hierarchy

The Single template hierarchy is fired when a visitor lands upon a single post or a single entry from a custom post type. The following hierarchy is used to determine the template:

- `{custom-template}.html`
- `single-{post_type}-{post_name}.html`
- `single-{post_type}.html`
- `single.html`
- `singular.html`
- `index.html`

A custom post type of `product` with a post name (i.e., slug) of `blue-shirt` would use this hierarchy:

- `{custom-template}.html`
- `single-product-blue-shirt.html`
- `single-product.html`
- `single.html`
- `singular.html`
- `index.html`

The core WordPress `page` and `attachment` post types are special cases and are handled differently from the default Single template hierarchy. See the below Page and Attachment sections for more details.

#### Page hierarchy

The Page template hierarchy fires when someone visits a single page on your website. This hierarchy is used to determine the template:

- `{custom-template}.html`
- `page-{post_name}.html`
- `page-{post_id}.html`
- `page.html`
- `index.html`

A page with a post name (i.e., slug) of `about-me` and an ID of `200` would use this hierarchy:

- `{custom-template}.html`
- `page-about-me.html`
- `page-200.html`
- `page.html`
- `index.html`

#### Attachment (media) hierarchy

When visiting the singular views for attachments (media file pages), WordPress prepends the default Single template hierarchy with some additional templates. This is the Attachment template hierarchy:

- `{mime_type}-{sub_type}.html`
- `{sub_type}.html`
- `{mime_type}.html`
- `attachment.html`
- Falls back to the default [Single template hierarchy](#single-hierarchy)

If you had an attachment with the `image/jpeg` mime type, the `image` piece of that would be considered the `mime_type`, and the `jpeg` part would be the `sub_type`.

Suppose you had an attachment with the `image/jpeg` type and the post name (i.e., slug) of `red-bird`. The full attachment template hierarchy would be:

- `image-jpeg.html`
- `jpeg.html`
- `image.html`
- `attachment.html`
- `{custom-template}.html`
- `single-attachment-red-bird.html`
- `single-attachment.html`
- `single.html`
- `singular.html`
- `index.html`

As of WordPress 6.4, attachment pages are [no longer enabled by default](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/16/changes-to-attachment-pages/) on new installations. Users can enable them with a plugin, so it is still good practice to test your theme and ensure it properly displays content when viewing an attachment page.

#### Privacy Policy page hierarchy

The Privacy Policy page in WordPress is a special case in comparison to other pages. WordPress will look for a `privacy-policy.html` template before looking at the normal page template hierarchy. For the Privacy Policy page, the following is the template hierarchy:

- `privacy-policy.html`
- Falls back to the [Page template hierarchy](#page-hierarchy)

### Archive hierarchy

Archives in WordPress display posts that are grouped by either some type of metadata (e.g., date, author, post type) or by a taxonomy term (category, tag).

#### Taxonomy term hierarchy

When working with publicly-rendered taxonomies, each term within the taxonomy will have its own archive page. The taxonomy term template hierarchy is:

- `taxonomy-{taxonomy_slug}-{term_slug}.html`
- `taxonomy-{taxonomy_slug}.html`
- `taxonomy.html`
- `archive.html`
- `index.html`

If you had a taxonomy with the slug of `location` and a term within that taxonomy with the slug of `alabama`, the template hierarchy would become:

- `taxonomy-location-alabama.html`
- `taxonomy-location.html`
- `taxonomy.html`
- `archive.html`
- `index.html`

The core WordPress `category` and `post_tag` taxonomies do not use the taxonomy term template. See the Category and Tag sections below for more details.

#### Category hierarchy

When a visitor clicks on a category link and views the category archive page, the following template hierarchy is used:

- `category-{slug}.html`
- `category-{id}.html`
- `category.html`
- `archive.html`
- `index.html`

When viewing a category archive where the category slug is `news` and the category ID is `123`, the template hierarchy becomes:

- `category-news.html`
- `category-123.html`
- `category.html`
- `archive.html`
- `index.html`

#### Tag hierarchy

When a visitor clicks on a tag link and views a tag archive page, the following template hierarchy is used:

- `tag-{slug}.html`
- `tag-{id}.html`
- `tag.html`
- `archive.html`
- `index.html`

When viewing a tag archive where the tag slug is `flowers` and the tag ID is `456`, the template hierarchy becomes:

- `tag-flowers.html`
- `tag-456.html`
- `tag.html`
- `archive.html`
- `index.html`

#### Post type archive hierarchy

A custom post type can have a publicly-facing archive page, which essentially serves as an index page for that post type, listing its latest posts by default (though, this can be filtered and changed). When a visitor views a post type archive, the template hierarchy is:

- `archive-{post_type}.html`
- `archive.html`
- `index.html`

If you had a post type with the slug of `portfolio_project`, its hierarchy would be:

- `archive-portfolio_project.html`
- `archive.html`
- `index.html`

The core WordPress `post` post type uses the [Home template hierarchy](#home-hierarchy), and the default `page` and `attachment` post types do not have archive views.

#### Author hierarchy

Despite its use of the term “author,” an author archive is one part user profile and one part post author archives. An archive URL is generated for all users on a WordPress site, regardless of whether they have published posts. But the intent of the author template is generally to display some metadata about the user and list their posts.

When visiting an author archive page on the front end of a site, this is the template hierarchy:

- `author-{user_nicename}.html`
- `author-{user_id}.html`
- `author.html`
- `archive.html`
- `index.html`

When visiting an author archive page for a user with a nicename of `matt` and an ID of `333`, the author archive template hierarchy becomes:

- `author-matt.html`
- `author-333.html`
- `author.html`
- `archive.html`
- `index.html`

#### Date hierarchy

When viewing a date or datetime-based archive page (e.g., yearly, monthly, weekly archives), The template hierarchy is:

- `date.html`
- `archive.html`
- `index.html`

### Search hierarchy

The search template hierarchy is used when viewing the search results on your website. It is similar to archives in that it lists multiple posts, but it is not technically an archive page. The template hierarchy for search results is:

- `search.html`
- `index.html`

### 404 (not found) hierarchy

When a URL is visited on the website that doesn’t exist, WordPress looks for a 404 template, which is intended to provide some helpful information about the page not existing. The template hierarchy for 404 pages is:

- `404.html`
- `index.html`

### Embed hierarchy

The embed template is used when one site embeds a post from your WordPress site. WordPress wraps the output in an `<iframe>` and displays the embedded content according to the template.

[Embed templates are not supported](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/47717) by the block templates system. To build and use custom embed templates, they must be located in your theme’s root folder and use the PHP file extension.

The template hierarchy for embedded content is:

- `embed-{post_type}-{post_format}.php`
- `embed-{post_type}.php`
- `embed.php`

If a custom embed template is not included in the theme, WordPress will use the `/wp-includes/theme-compat/embed.php` template bundled with core. It does not fall back to the index template like other template types.

If you were embedding a post with a post type of `post` and the post format of `image`, the hierarchy becomes:

- `embed-post-image.php`
- `embed-post.php`
- `embed.php`

# Template Parts <a name="themes/templates/template-parts" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/templates/template-parts/

[Templates](#themes/templates/templates) represent the top-level document structure for the front end of a website. But ***template parts*** represent smaller sections of content that can be included in one or more templates.

Some common parts are:

- Header
- Footer
- Sidebar
- Comments

You can have many more parts. These are generally pieces of the design that are reused within multiple top-level templates. Parts are not a requirement for your theme, but they are a nice-to-use feature that lets you better manage your files and code.

In [Introduction to Templates](#themes/templates/introduction-to-templates), you learned about the basics of template parts. In this document, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how they work.

## How do template parts work?

As you learned in the Templates documentation, WordPress locates a top-level template based on which page a visitor is viewing on the website. This located template is then loaded, and WordPress parses the block markup before sending it back to the browser.

Unlike templates, parts are not automatically loaded based on the currently-viewed page. They must be included as a *part* of the top-level template via the [Template Part block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-part-block/).

The Template Part block’s markup looks like this:

```markup
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"your-template-part-slug"} /-->
```

There are more block settings that you can include, but the `slug` property **must** be set to load the correct part. When WordPress encounters the Template Part block markup during its parsing process, it will look for a file named `/parts/your-template-part-slug.html` in your theme folder. If found, it will load the file and parse its block markup.

Let’s look at a simple template that loads both a Header and Footer part:

```markup
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header","tagName":"header"} /-->

<!-- Other block markup goes here. -->

<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer","tagName":"footer"} /-->
```

As you can see, a `tagName` setting was also included for the Header and Footer parts. This sets the wrapping container elements to `<header>` and `<footer>`, respectively.

If this is the block markup included in a top-level template, WordPress would go through these steps:

1. Load the `/parts/header.html` file and parse its block markup.
2. Parse the template’s other block markup.
3. Load the `/parts/footer.html` file and parse its block markup.

## What’s in a template part?

Template parts in block themes contain block markup and nothing else.

Let’s look at a simple Footer template part that shows a Site Title block and a Paragraph block with a “Powered by WordPress” message. To recreate this, you would add a `/parts/footer.html` file in your theme with this block markup:

```markup
<!-- wp:group {"align":"wide","layout":{"type":"flex","orientation":"vertical","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group alignwide">
	<!-- wp:site-title {"level":0} /-->

	<!-- wp:paragraph -->
		<p>Powered by WordPress.</p>
	<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
</div>
<!-- /wp:group -->
```

This is merely an example that shows block markup and how it *could* look in a part. Template parts can be even simpler or much more complex, depending on what you want to include in them.

For a more in-depth look at the architecture of a block, check out the [Key Concepts](#block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts) documentation in the Block Editor Handbook.

## Organizing template parts

With block themes, you must put template parts within your theme’s `/parts` folder. It should be structured like this:

- `parts/`
    - `comments.html`
    - `footer.html`
    - `header.html`
    - `sidebar.html`

None of those are required. In fact, you don’t even have to include any template parts at all.  
WordPress does not currently [support nested template parts](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/54279). For example, you cannot create a `/parts/header` folder and put multiple header parts within it. All template parts must be placed directly within your theme’s `/parts` folder.

Technically, WordPress will also look in the `/block-template-parts` folder if it exists in your theme. This is for backward compatibility with an older version of WordPress. But it is recommended to always use the `/parts` folder instead.

## Building template parts

It’s possible to manually write the block markup code for all of your template parts. But, in most cases, you will want to work directly within the WordPress admin and its visual editor. Then, migrate the block markup from the editor to your template part files as described in [Introduction to Templates](#themes/templates/introduction-to-templates).

To explore working with the visual interface, read the support guides on using the Site and Template Editors:

- [Template Part Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-part-block/)
- [Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/)
- [Template Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/)
    - [How to edit templates via the Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/#how-to-edit-templates-via-the-site-editor)
    - [How to use the Template Editor via the WordPress Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/#how-to-edit-templates-via-the-post-editor)

### Registering template parts

While not required, you should almost always register template parts via `theme.json`. Doing so will ensure that they appear in the user interface for use with the Site and Template editors with nice labels that can be translated.

Registering template parts is covered in the [Template Parts](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/template-parts) documentation under the [Global Settings and Styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles) chapter.

### Editing template parts

To access templates from the WordPress admin, open the **Appearance &gt; Editor** menu in the admin menu. Then click the **Patterns** item in the sidebar and scroll to find the **Template Parts** section:

[![WordPress Template Parts section under the Patterns library in the Site Editor. A Post Meta and Comments part are both shown on the screen.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/parts-site-editor.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/parts-site-editor.jpg?ssl=1)Template Parts are categorized by template part areas (read “Template part areas” section below for more information). Each area lists the parts that are registered for it (note that **General** is the `uncategorized` area).

The template parts shown can come from three locations:

- User-created template parts saved in the database (these are stored as posts in the `wp_template_part` post type)
- Template parts from the theme’s `/parts` folder
- Template parts dynamically added by plugins

From this screen, you can make any customizations you want to the parts, adjusting them to fit your vision.

Remember that if you save the parts from this screen, they will be stored in the database and will overrule any templates in your theme. If you plan to distribute this theme to others or use it on another site, you must copy the block markup to the matching template in your `/parts` folder as described in [Introduction to Templates](#themes/templates/introduction-to-templates).

### Adding new template parts

You can create a new template by clicking the **+** icon next to **Patterns** heading. This will display a dropdown with several options. Click the **Create template part** option as shown here:

[![WordPress Patterns library. A dropdown is shown with the Create Template Part option highlighted.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/parts-add-new-dropdown.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/parts-add-new-dropdown.jpg?ssl=1)Then a popup modal will appear for you to enter a custom template part name and select its area:

[![WordPress Site Editor with a modal for creating a template part overlaying the screen.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/parts-add-new-modal.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/parts-add-new-modal.jpg?ssl=1)By default, you can select from the General, Header, and Footer areas (to learn more about creating custom areas, read the “Template part areas” section below).

From the next screen, you will be able to create an entirely custom template part. It can include any blocks that you prefer.

Again, any new parts you add via the editor are saved in the database. You must create the template part file inside your `/parts` folder and copy the block markup to it if you intend to distribute your theme.

## Template part areas

Template part areas are essentially a way to organize similar template parts. They also appear as navigational elements within the user interface. Below, you can see the **Header** area highlighted in the template-editing sidebar:

[![WordPress site editor showing a template with a three-column grid of posts. In the sidebar, the Header area is selected.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/parts-area-navigation.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/parts-area-navigation.jpg?ssl=1)By default, WordPress has three areas that you can register your templates for:

- `uncategorized` (labeled as **General** in the admin)
- `header`
- `footer`

That will cover some common use cases (almost all themes need a header and footer, for example). But you may want to create custom areas for your themes to better organize your template parts and provide a nicer user experience.

### Registering custom areas

You can register as many custom areas you want by adding a filter to the [`default_wp_template_part_areas` hook](#reference/hooks/default_wp_template_part_areas). Your callback function accepts a single parameter of `$areas`, which must be an array of area definitions. Each area definition must be an array with these key/value pairs defined:

- **`area`:** The machine-readable slug for your template part area.
- **`area_tag`:** The wrapping HTML tag to use for template parts assigned to this area. Can be one of the following: 
    - `div`
    - `article`
    - `aside`
    - `footer`
    - `header`
    - `main`
    - `section`
- **`label`:** A human-readable label for your area, which may be translated.
- **`description`:** A description of your area and what template parts belong to it, which may be translated.
- **`icon`:** The icon to use for the area. Note that only `header`, `footer`, and `sidebar` are currently supported with everything else falling back to a default icon, at least until [this ticket is addressed](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/36814).

Suppose you wanted to create an area named Loop to assign template parts used throughout your theme. You could do so by adding this code to your theme’s `functions.php` file:

```php
add_filter( 'default_wp_template_part_areas', 'themeslug_template_part_areas' );

function themeslug_template_part_areas( array $areas ) {
	$areas[] = array(
		'area'        => 'loop',
		'area_tag'    => 'section',
		'label'       => __( 'Loop', 'themeslug' ),
		'description' => __( 'Custom description', 'themslug' ),
		'icon'        => 'layout'
	);

	return $areas;
}
```

This would register a new Loop area for your theme, but for it to be useful, you need to also register at least one template part for it as described in the [`theme.json` documentation on registering template parts](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/template-parts).

Suppose you also created a `/parts/loop-default.html` template part. You could assign it to your new `loop` area in `theme.json` with this code:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"templateParts": [
		{
			"area": "loop",
			"name": "loop-default",
			"title": "Loop - Default"
		}
	]
}
```

This screenshot shows what the **Loop** area would look like in the Site Editor:

[![Template Parts section in the Patterns library in the WordPress Site Editor. A custom Loop template part area is selected.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/parts-custom-area.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/parts-custom-area.jpg?ssl=1)You can register as many template parts for an area as you need via `theme.json`. For example, you could register a `loop-home.html` and `loop-author.html` to use in your Home and Author templates, respectively. But these are mere examples. The only limit is your imagination.

There are many reasons you might want to register custom areas. For a deeper dive into the benefits and features of this system, read [Upgrading the site-editing experience with custom template part areas](#news/2023/06/upgrading-the-site-editing-experience-with-custom-template-part-areas) from the WordPress Developer Blog.

# Block Patterns (Archived) <a name="themes/features/block-patterns" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/features/block-patterns/

This documentation article has now been archived and replaced with the newer [Patterns chapter](#themes/patterns) of the Theme Handbook. Please refer to that page for the most up-to-date information on patterns.

Block patterns are one of the most powerful features at a theme author’s disposal. Introduced in WordPress 5.4, patterns made it easier for users to insert more complex layouts from the block editor while opening a world of possibilities to designers.

## What are block patterns? 

Essentially, a block pattern is nothing more than one or more blocks that have been pre-configured and presented to the end-user. Think of them as reusable groups of blocks.

They are ideal as starting points for users to insert into their post and page content, but they are also useful when used inside of templates.

Users can insert them directly into a template from the Site Editor or into their content from the Post Editor:

[![WordPress post editor with the Inserter open and the Patterns tab selected.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/patterns-insert.jpg?resize=2048%2C1072&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/patterns-insert.jpg?ssl=1)In comparison to [template parts](#themes/templates/template-parts), which is a similar feature for reusable groups of blocks, patterns also give you access to PHP. This means that you can internationalize text within them, dynamically add URLs to include images, and more.

Note that users can also create and manage custom patterns from the **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Patterns** screen in the admin. You can also use this screen to manage your own patterns in your development install:

[![WordPress patterns library in the admin showing the All Patterns screen. On the right, a three-column grid of patterns are shown in preview boxes.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/patterns-all.jpg?resize=2048%2C1072&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/patterns-all.jpg?ssl=1)## Working with block patterns

In this section, you will learn how to create custom block patterns, register them in your theme, and unregister them. You will also learn some useful tips, tricks, and other methods for working with patterns.

### Creating block patterns

The easiest way to learn to create block patterns is to start by putting a few blocks together in the Post Editor. This can be anything you like, but for the purposes of this article, the code shared below will be of a core Cover block with some blocks nested within it, following this structure:

- Group 
    - Heading
    - Paragraph
    - Buttons 
        - Button

Try recreating this yourself, especially if you are just getting used to working with the block editor. You can also customize this however you like, but it’s recommended to keep this relatively simple for your first time creating a pattern.

Once you’re finished, click the **⋮** (Options) icon in the toolbar and click **Copy**:

[![WordPress post editor with a Cover block in the content canvas. A dropdown is open from the toolbar with the Copy button highlighted.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/patterns-create-copy.jpg?resize=2048%2C1072&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/patterns-create-copy.jpg?ssl=1)This will give you the code you need to work with, which should be similar to this:

```markup
<!-- wp:cover {"overlayColor":"contrast","align":"full"} -->
<div class="wp-block-cover alignfull"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-contrast-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim"></span><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container"><!-- wp:group {"style":{"spacing":{"blockGap":"2.5rem"}},"layout":{"type":"constrained","wideSize":"%","contentSize":"75%"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Welcome to My Site</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">This is my little home away from home. Here, you will get to know me.  I'll share my likes, hobbies, and more.  Every now and then, I'll even have something interesting to say in a blog post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:buttons {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-buttons"><!-- wp:button {"className":"is-style-outline"} -->
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button">See My Popular Posts <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">→</span></a></div>
<!-- /wp:button --></div>
<!-- /wp:buttons --></div>
<!-- /wp:group --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:cover -->
```

For the remainder of this article, you will work with this same pattern, learning how to register it, unregister it, and customize it further.

It’s good practice to wrap most patterns in a Group, Cover, or other container block (i.e., a block that allows nested blocks). This makes it easier for your theme users to move the entire pattern around in the editor. You can also add a CSS class to this outer block for any custom styling that applies to the entire pattern.

### Registering block patterns

There are two methods for registering block patterns in WordPress:

- By placing files with block markup in them into the `/patterns` folder in your theme.
- By manually calling the `register_block_pattern()` function.

The most straightforward route is the first. You’ll learn how to do both in the next sections, but this handbook will recommend using the `/patterns` folder except for in some edge cases.

#### Using the /patterns directory to register patterns

WordPress will recognize any pattern file placed in your theme’s `/patterns` folder, and it will automatically register it for you, provided that it has a valid pattern file header.

A [file header](https://codex.wordpress.org/File_Header) is PHP-commented code with a list of key + value pairs at the top of a file. WordPress parses this information to gather metadata. In this case, the metadata is used to register a block pattern.

For pattern file headers, these are the keys that you can set:

- **`Title`:** A human-readable title that can be translated.
- **`Slug`:** A namespaced slug that is unique to your pattern in the form of `namespace/pattern-name`.
- **`Categories`:** A comma-separated list of categories in which the pattern belongs.
- **`Description`:** The long description of the registered pattern. Only shown to screen readers.
- **`Viewport Width`:** The width of the `<iframe>` viewport when previewing the pattern (in pixels).
- **`Inserter`:** Whether to show the pattern in the inserter. Defaults to `true`.
- **`Keywords`:** A comma-separated list of keywords related to the pattern for search.
- **`Block Types`:** A comma-separated list of block types to associate the pattern with.
- **`Post Types`:** A comma-separated list of post types in which to limit the pattern. Defaults to all post types.
- **`Template Types`:** A comma-separated list of template types the pattern fits with.

For most patterns, you should at least add the `Title`, `Slug`, and `Categories` fields. Pattern files should look like this:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Hero
 * Slug: themeslug/hero
 * Categories: featured
 */
?>
<!-- Pattern code goes here. -->
```

Now let’s add the code that you copied from the previous section into the `/patterns/hero.php` file in your theme:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Hero
 * Slug: themeslug/hero
 * Categories: featured
 */
?>
<!-- wp:cover {"overlayColor":"contrast","align":"full"} -->
<div class="wp-block-cover alignfull"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-contrast-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim"></span><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container"><!-- wp:group {"style":{"spacing":{"blockGap":"2.5rem"}},"layout":{"type":"constrained","wideSize":"%","contentSize":"75%"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Welcome to My Site</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">This is my little home away from home. Here, you will get to know me. I'll share my likes, hobbies, and more. Every now and then, I'll even have something interesting to say in a blog post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:buttons {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-buttons"><!-- wp:button {"className":"is-style-outline"} -->
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button">See My Popular Posts <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">→</span></a></div>
<!-- /wp:button --></div>
<!-- /wp:buttons --></div>
<!-- /wp:group --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:cover -->
```

Now if you add or edit a new post in WordPress, you should see your pattern listed in the inserter. Click the **Patterns** tab and select **Featured**:

[![WordPress post editor with the Patterns > Featured category selected in the Inserter. A single pattern is listed.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/patterns-insert-custom.jpg?resize=2048%2C924&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/patterns-insert-custom.jpg?ssl=1)You should also be able to see your pattern listed under **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Patterns** in the WordPress admin.

#### Using PHP to register patterns

Instead of using the `/patterns` folder to auto-register your patterns, you may choose to manually register them via PHP. You can mix and match both registration methods, but an individual pattern must be registered with only one method.

To register block patterns with PHP, you must use the [`register_block_pattern()`](#reference/functions/register_block_pattern) function. Here is what its signature looks like:

```php
register_block_pattern( 
	string $pattern_name, 
	array $pattern_properties 
): bool
```

The function accepts two parameters and returns `true` or `false`, depending on whether the pattern was successfully registered:

- **`$pattern_name`:** A namespaced slug that is unique to your pattern in the form of `namespace/pattern-name`.
- **`$pattern_properties`:**
    - **`content`:** The block markup for the pattern.
    - **`title`:** A human-readable title that can be translated.
    - **`slug`:** A namespaced slug that is unique to your pattern in the form of `namespace/pattern-name`.
    - **`categories`:** An array of categories in which the pattern belongs.
    - **`description`:** The long description of the registered pattern. Only shown to screen readers.
    - **`viewportWidth`:** The width of the `<iframe>` viewport when previewing the pattern (in pixels).
    - **`inserter`:** Whether to show the pattern in the inserter. Defaults to `true`.
    - **`keywords`:** An array of keywords related to the pattern for search.
    - **`blockTypes`:** An array of block types to associate the pattern with.
    - **`postTypes`:** An array of post types in which to limit the pattern. Defaults to all post types.
    - **`source`:** The source for the registered pattern. This should be set to `theme` since the pattern is coming from a theme.
    - **`templateTypes`:** An array of template types the pattern fits with.

When registering patterns via PHP, you should do so on the `init` hook. Now try registering your custom pattern by adding this code in `functions.php` (be sure to add your custom markup to the `content` property):

```php
add_action( 'init', 'themeslug_register_patterns' );

function themeslug_register_patterns() {
	register_block_pattern( 'themeslug/hero', array(
		'title'      => __( 'Hero', 'themeslug' ),
		'categories' => array( 'featured' ),
		'source'     => 'theme',
		'content'    => '<!-- Block pattern goes here. -->'
	) );
}
```

### Including patterns in templates

When building themes, patterns are not merely reusable sections of blocks that users can add to their content. That is a nice feature, but the true power of patterns is using them directly in your theme’s front-end output.

You can include patterns in your [templates](#themes/templates/templates) or [template parts](#themes/templates/template-parts) by adding the Pattern block markup and passing along the pattern slug.

Here is what the Pattern block markup would look like when calling your existing “hero” pattern:

```markup
<!-- wp:pattern {"slug":"themeslug/hero"} /-->
```

That should be relatively straightforward. All you need to know is the `slug` value from when you registered the pattern.

Now try adding it to one of your theme’s templates, such as `/templates/home.html` or `/templates/index.html` below the header. Your template with the pattern code should look similar to this:

```markup
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header"} /-->

<!-- wp:pattern {"slug":"themeslug/hero"} /-->

<!-- Some other blocks. /-->

<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer"} /-->
```

Now test the addition of the pattern in the Site Editor by going to **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Templates** and choosing the template you added it to:

[![WordPress Site Editor showing the Blog posts index template. The content shows a Header template part and a block pattern with the Cover block beneath it.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/patterns-template-include.jpg?resize=2048%2C924&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/patterns-template-include.jpg?ssl=1)### Unregistering block patterns

There are times when you need to unregister block patterns so that they do not appear in the inserter for users. For example, you may want to remove some of the core WordPress patterns, those added by a parent theme (if you’re building a child theme), or those added by third-party plugins.

When you need to unregister a single block pattern, you’ll use the [`unregister_block_pattern()`](#reference/functions/unregister_block_pattern) function:

```php
unregister_block_pattern( string $pattern_name ): bool
```

Like when registering patterns, you’ll also want to unregister on the `init` hook. Because patterns are generally (but not always) registered with the default priority `10` on `init`, you’ll want to use a higher priority so that your code runs later.

Try unregistering your custom pattern from earlier by adding this code to your `functions.php` file:

```php
add_action( 'init', 'themeslug_unregister_patterns', 999 );

function themeslug_unregister_patterns() {
	unregister_block_pattern( 'themeslug/hero' );
}
```

### Removing core patterns

While you can use `unregister_block_pattern()` to unregister individual core WordPress patterns, you can also choose to get rid of all of them by removing support for the `core-block-patterns` feature.

To remove all core WordPress patterns, add this code to your theme’s `functions.php` file:

```php
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'themeslug_remove_core_patterns' );

function themeslug_remove_core_patterns() {
	remove_theme_support( 'core-block-patterns' );
}
```

### Disabling remote patterns

WordPress also automatically loads some patterns remotely from the official [Pattern Directory](https://wordpress.org/patterns/) on WordPress.org. There are some situations where you might not want to load these patterns, such as when they don’t match your theme design. You may also want to opt out of calling a remote API on a site that you’re building for a client. Whatever the case, you can disable this by filtering the [`should_load_remote_block_patterns`](#reference/hooks/should_load_remote_block_patterns) hook.

To disable remote patterns, add this code to your `functions.php` file:

```php
add_filter( 'should_load_remote_block_patterns', '__return_false' );
```

### Tips and tricks

Below, you’ll find various tips, tricks, and other useful features that make block patterns a powerful and flexible part of WordPress theme development.

#### Internationalizing text in patterns

One of the primary use cases for block patterns is [internationalizing text](#themes/functionality/internationalization) (making it ready for translation). For example, if you have text in a template or template part, the only way to internationalize that text is to move it into a pattern, where you have full access to PHP.

Because pattern files are just PHP, you can use any of the internationalization functions within WordPress. In the below example, you’ll use [`esc_html_e()`](#reference/functions/esc_html_e) to both escape the text for security and make it ready for translators.

Try taking your “hero” pattern example and wrapping the custom text inside the Heading, Paragraph, and Button blocks with the `esc_html_e()` function. Your pattern file should look like this:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Hero
 * Slug: themeslug/hero
 * Categories: featured
 */
?>
<!-- wp:cover {"overlayColor":"contrast","align":"full"} -->
<div class="wp-block-cover alignfull"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-contrast-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim"></span><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container"><!-- wp:group {"style":{"spacing":{"blockGap":"2.5rem"}},"layout":{"type":"constrained","wideSize":"%","contentSize":"75%"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><?php esc_html_e( 'Welcome to My Site', 'themeslug' ) ?></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><?php esc_html_e( "This is my little home away from home. Here, you will get to know me. I'll share my likes, hobbies, and more. Every now and then, I'll even have something interesting to say in a blog post.", 'themeslug' ) ?></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:buttons {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-buttons"><!-- wp:button {"className":"is-style-outline"} -->
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php esc_html_e( 'See My Popular Posts <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">→</span>', 'themeslug' ) ?></a></div>
<!-- /wp:button --></div>
<!-- /wp:buttons --></div>
<!-- /wp:group --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:cover -->
```

#### Using images and other assets

Adding dynamic URLs for images and other assets is another important feature of patterns. Because you have PHP access, you can use functions like `get_theme_file_uri()` to output an image URL that’s bundled with your theme, for example.

Try adding an image background to your “hero” pattern’s Cover block. If you need an image, try grabbing one from the WordPress [Photo Directory](https://wordpress.org/photos/) (the example below uses this [Nepal night scene photo](https://wordpress.org/photos/photo/41664fab9b/)).

Download an image and save it to your theme’s `/assets/images` folder (or a folder of your choice) and name it `hero-background.jpg`.

Then open your pattern in the editor and upload the image as the background for the Cover block, which should look like this:

[![WordPress post editor showing a Cover block with a background image of a cityscape.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/patterns-cover-with-background.jpg?resize=2048%2C924&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/patterns-cover-with-background.jpg?ssl=1)As you did earlier, copy the blocks that make up the pattern. You’ll notice that you have two instances of the image URL in your pattern code. It will be a hardcoded URL similar to this:

```markup
http://localhost/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/hero-background.jpg
```

You need to change both of those instances so that they point to the image that is located in your theme’s `/assets/images` folder. For this, you need do two things:

- Get the correct URL using a function like [`get_theme_file_uri()`](#reference/functions/get_theme_file_uri).
- Escape the URL so that it’s safe for output with [`esc_url()`](#reference/functions/esc_url).

Change the hard coded image URLs to this:

```php
<?php echo esc_url( get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/images/hero-background.jpg' ) ) ?>
```

Your final pattern code should look like this (note that this example includes internationalized text as explained in the previous section):

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Hero
 * Slug: themeslug/hero
 * Categories: featured
 */
?>
<!-- wp:cover {"url":"<?php echo esc_url( get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/images/hero-background.jpg' ) ) ?>","id":3838,"dimRatio":50,"overlayColor":"contrast","align":"full"} -->
<div class="wp-block-cover alignfull"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-contrast-background-color has-background-dim"></span><img class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-3838" alt="" src="<?php echo esc_url( get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/images/hero-background.jpg' ) ) ?>" data-object-fit="cover"/><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container"><!-- wp:group {"style":{"spacing":{"blockGap":"2.5rem"}},"layout":{"type":"constrained","wideSize":"%","contentSize":"75%"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><?php esc_html_e( 'Welcome to My Site', 'themeslug' ) ?></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><?php esc_html_e( "This is my little home away from home. Here, you will get to know me. I'll share my likes, hobbies, and more. Every now and then, I'll even have something interesting to say in a blog post.", 'themeslug' ) ?></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:buttons {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-buttons"><!-- wp:button {"className":"is-style-outline"} -->
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php esc_html_e( 'See My Popular Posts <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">→</span>', 'themeslug' ) ?></a></div>
<!-- /wp:button --></div>
<!-- /wp:buttons --></div>
<!-- /wp:group --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:cover -->
```

#### Conditionally loading third-party blocks

There are times when you might want to only use a block if it is registered on the user’s install. This is particularly true for third-party blocks that may be contained in a plugin.

It’s important to note that WordPress will prompt a user to install the block if you add its block markup and it’s not installed. It won’t result in a broken website, so it’s OK to avoid using the method described in this section.

But if you would prefer to hide an unregistered block (or use an alternative), you can conditionally check if a block is registered via the [`WP_Block_Type_Registry::is_registered()`](#reference/classes/wp_block_type_registry/is_registered) method.

This example code shows how to check for the `core/paragraph` block. If it’s registered, it will output the block markup:

```php
<?php if ( WP_Block_Type_Registry::get_instance()->is_registered( 'core/paragraph' ) ) : ?>
	<!-- Add your block markup here. -->
<?php endif ?>
```

Try applying this method to your registered “hero” block from earlier by wrapping the Paragraph block in this conditional check. Here’s what your pattern code should look like:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Hero
 * Slug: themeslug/hero
 * Categories: featured

Of course, since the Paragraph block is registered by core WordPress and assuming it hasn’t been unregistered, your Paragraph block should appear in the editor and on the front end. The primary use case for this is to conditionally check third-party blocks.

### Conditionally registering patterns

If you need to conditionally register an entire pattern instead of simply conditionally outputting specific parts of it (shown in the previous section), there are two methods to choose from, depending on how you prefer to register patterns.

#### Conditionally registering patterns in the /patterns folder

If you have used the auto-registration method of placing your pattern in your theme’s `/patterns` folder, there is no true way to conditionally register it. What you must do in this case is unregister the pattern.

Suppose that you wanted to only make the hero pattern you registered earlier available if the `core/paragraph` block is registered. In a real-world scenario, you’d likely be checking for a third-party block, and the `core/paragraph` block is used only for the sake of this example.

Try this code inside of your `functions.php` file to unregister your previously-registered pattern:

```php
add_action( 'init', 'themeslug_unregister_patterns', 999 );

function themeslug_unregister_patterns() {
	if ( WP_Block_Type_Registry::get_instance()->is_registered( 'core/paragraph' ) ) {
		unregister_block_pattern( 'themeslug/hero' );
	}
}
```

#### Conditionally registering patterns via [register\_block\_pattern()](#reference/functions/register_block_pattern) 

If you manually registered your patterns via PHP, you only need to wrap your call to `register_block_pattern()` with your conditional check.

Using the same example as above, try only registering your pattern if the `core/paragraph` block is registered by adding this to `functions.php`:

```php
add_action( 'init', 'themeslug_register_patterns', 999 );

function themeslug_register_patterns() {
	if ( WP_Block_Type_Registry::get_instance()->is_registered( 'core/paragraph' ) ) {
		register_block_pattern( 'themeslug/hero', array(
			'title'      => __( 'Hero', 'themeslug' ),
			'categories' => array( 'featured' ),
			'source'     => 'theme',
			'content'    => '<!-- Block pattern goes here. -->'
		) );
	}
}
```

## Pattern categories

WordPress has several block pattern categories that it registers by default:

- `featured`
- `about`
- `audio` (added in WordPress 6.4)
- `banner`
- `buttons`
- `call-to-action`
- `columns`
- `contact`
- `footer`
- `gallery`
- `header`
- `media`
- `portfolio`
- `posts`
- `query` (use `posts` instead)
- `services`
- `team`
- `testimonials`
- `text`
- `video` (added in WordPress 6.4)

It’s generally best to use these default categories for your theme. This keeps a consistent UI that users will be accustomed to. But there are times when you may want to add your own categories or even remove those that are already registered.

In this section of the article, you’ll learn how to both register and unregister custom block pattern categories.

### Registering a pattern category

To register a custom category for putting one or more of your patterns into, you must use the [`register_block_pattern_category()`](#reference/functions/register_block_pattern_category) function:

```php
register_block_pattern_category( 
	string $category_name, 
	array $category_properties 
): bool
```

The function accepts two parameters:

- **`$category_name`:** A unique ID/slug for the category. It’s good practice to prefix this with your theme slug.
- **`$category_properties`:** An array of properties for defining further data about the category: 
    - **`label`:** A human-readable label/title for the category that may be translated.
    - **`description`:** A description for the category that may be translated.

Try adding a new custom pattern category for your theme. Add this code to your theme’s `functions.php` file:

```php
add_action( 'init', 'themeslug_register_pattern_categories' );

function themeslug_register_pattern_categories() {
	register_block_pattern_category( 'themeslug/custom', array( 
		'label'       => __( 'Theme Name: Custom', 'themeslug' ),
		'description' => __( 'Custom patterns for Theme Name.', 'themeslug' )
	) );
}
```

Now try adding the `themeslug/custom` category to any block pattern:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Hero
 * Slug: themeslug/hero
 * Categories: featured, themeslug/custom
 */
?>
<!-- Your block markup goes here. -->
```

Any registered patterns for this category will now appear in the inserter and under **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Patterns**:

[![Custom pattern category showing a single pattern in the WordPress Patterns library.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/patterns-category.jpg?resize=2048%2C924&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/patterns-category.jpg?ssl=1)### Unregistering a pattern category

To unregister a registered pattern category, you must use the [`unregister_block_pattern_category()`](#reference/functions/unregister_block_pattern_category) function:

```php
unregister_block_pattern_category( string $category_name ): bool
```

The function accepts a single parameter:

- **`$category_name`:** The name (i.e., slug) of the registered category to unregister.

Try adding this code to your `functions.php` to remove the `themeslug/custom` category you registered in the previous step:

```php
add_action( 'init', 'themeslug_unregister_pattern_categories' );<br></br><br></br>function themeslug_unregister_pattern_categories() {<br></br>	unregister_block_pattern_category( 'themeslug/custom' );<br></br>}
```

# Block Style Variations <a name="themes/features/block-style-variations" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/features/block-style-variations/

Block style variations (block styles, for short) let you create alternate styles for individual blocks. Registered styles appear in the user interface, allowing users to quickly switch between the default style and any alternates.

Many features, unfortunately, use the term “variations” in their name. This can be confusing at times. The biggest thing to note is that block style variations are not the same thing as [global style variations](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/style-variations) and [block variations](#themes/features/block-variations).

Often, you will see block style variations referred to as “block styles,” as they are in this article, but this should also not be confused with [block stylesheets](#themes/features/block-stylesheets). The two features can be used to work together, but they are not the same thing.

## What are block styles?

Under the hood, block styles are nothing more than CSS classes added to a block’s wrapping element with the name of `.is-style-{name}`. This allows you to add custom CSS to alter the block’s design in some way.

In this screenshot, you can see multiple block styles registered for the Image block under the **Styles** panel, and the core **Rounded** option is selected:

[![WordPress post editor showing an Image block with a rounded style in the content canvas.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/block-styles-image-rounded.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/block-styles-image-rounded.jpg?ssl=1)All that is happening here is that core WordPress and the theme have both registered block styles for the Image block, and the user has selected one of those styles. Then the CSS for that registered style is applied to a block.

Ultimately, block styles are just a standard way to add a class to a block and customize it with CSS.

Users can only apply one style to a block at a time. They cannot combine them using the standard design tools. If you need to allow more options, you might consider building custom design tools. Read the [Beyond Block Styles](#news/tag/beyond-block-styles) tutorial series on the WordPress Developer Blog to learn how.

## PHP-based block styles

Most theme authors will want to register block styles with PHP. Skip ahead to the “JavaScript-based block styles” section if you need or want to work with them via JavaScript.

### Registering blocks styles with PHP

To register a block style, use the [`register_block_style()`](#reference/functions/register_block_style) PHP function. The function’s signature looks like this:

```php
register_block_style( 
	string $block_name, 
	array $style_properties
): bool
```

The function accepts two parameters and returns `true` or `false`, depending on whether the registration was successful:

- **`$block_name`:** The name of the block, including both the namespace and slug (e.g., `core/image`).
- **`$style_properties`:** An array of arguments that can be used to configure the style: 
    - **`name`:** *(Required)* A unique identifier/slug, which is used to generate the class (e.g., `is-style-{name}`).
    - **`label`:** *(Required)* An human-readable label, which may be translated.
    - **`inline_style`:** Inline CSS to be printed when the style is in use.
    - **`style_handle`:** A handle for a registered stylesheet to load for the style.
    - **`is_default`:** Whether the style should be selected as the default for the block (defaults to `false`).

`style_handle` [currently has a bug](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27244#issuecomment-1407082624) where it only enqueues the stylesheet in the editor but not on the front end. Until that linked ticket is addressed, its use is not recommended.

Let’s try creating a block style that gives the Image block a “hand drawn” look so that it looks like this when selected in the editor:

[![WordPress post editor showing an Image block with a hand-drawn style in the content canvas.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/block-styles-image-hand-drawn.jpg?resize=2048%2C1071&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/block-styles-image-hand-drawn.jpg?ssl=1)To register this block style, you need to configure it via the `register_block_style()` function and add it as a callback on the `init` hook.

Add the following code to your theme’s `functions.php` file to test it out:

```php
add_action( 'init', 'themeslug_register_block_styles' );

function themeslug_register_block_styles() {
	register_block_style( 'core/image', array(
		'name'         => 'hand-drawn',
		'label'        => __( 'Hand Drawn', 'themeslug' ),
		'inline_style' => '.wp-block-image.is-style-hand-drawn img {
			border: 2px solid currentColor;
			overflow: hidden;
			box-shadow: 0 4px  10px 0 rgba( 0, 0, 0, 0.3 );
			border-radius: 255px 15px 225px 15px/15px 225px 15px 255px !important;
		}'
    ) );
}
```

If your `inline_style` argument is more than a few lines of CSS code, you may want to add your CSS to a custom [block stylesheet](#themes/features/block-stylesheets) instead.

### Unregistering block styles with PHP

To unregister a block style that has been registered with PHP, use the [`unregister_block_style()`](#reference/functions/unregister_block_style) function. Here is a look at its signature:

```php
unregister_block_style(
	string $block_name, 
	string $block_style_name 
): bool
```

The function accepts two parameters and returns `true` or `false`, depending on whether the registration was successful:

- **`$block_name`:** The name of the block, including both its namespace and slug (e.g., `core/image`).
- **`$block_style_name`:** The name/slug of a block style that was registered via PHP.

To unregister the `hand-drawn` block style you registered earlier, you need to add an action function to the `init` hook (note the action call has a later priority of `99` so that it runs after the earlier registration function, which defaults to `10`):

```php
add_action( 'init', 'themeslug_register_block_styles', 999 );

function themeslug_register_block_styles() {
	unregister_block_style( 'core/image', 'hand-drawn' );
}
```

You can only unregister block styles with PHP if they have been registered via PHP. If the block style was registered with JavaScript, you must also use JavaScript to unregister it. For more information, see the “Unregistering block styles with JavaScript” section below.

## JavaScript-based block styles

To register or unregister block styles via JavaScript, you need to load a JavaScript file on the `enqueue_block_editor_assets` hook.

First, create an `/assets/js/block-editor.js` file in your theme (you can change this name or add it anywhere, but the example below assumes this name and location).

Then add this code to your theme’s `functions.php` file to enqueue your script:

```php
add_action( 'enqueue_block_editor_assets', 'themeslug_block_editor_assets' );

function themeslug_block_editor_assets() {
	wp_enqueue_script(
		'themeslug-block-editor',
		get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/js/block-editor.js' ),
		array( 
			'wp-blocks', 
			'wp-dom-ready', 
			'wp-edit-post' 
		)
	);
}
```

### Registering block styles with JavaScript

To register a block style via JavaScript, you’ll use the `registerBlockStyle()` function, which works similarly to the `register_block_style()` PHP function. It just uses JavaScript syntax.

Let’s use the same example from earlier and register a “hand drawn” Image block style. Add this code to your `/assets/js/block-editor.js` file:

```javascript
wp.blocks.registerBlockStyle( 'core/image', {
	name: 'hand-drawn',
	label: 'Hand Drawn'
} );
```

You can also set the `isDefault` argument to `true` if this is meant to be the default block style (it’s `false` by default).

For adding your custom CSS, you’ll need to load a custom [block stylesheet](#themes/features/block-stylesheets) or add your CSS by some other means.

### Unregistering block styles with JavaScript

There is also an `unregisterBlockStyle()` JavaScript function that is equivalent to the `unregister_block_style()` PHP function. You can use this to unregister any block styles that have been registered via JavaScript.

To avoid a race condition where there’s a conflict between when a block style is registered versus when it is unregistered, you need to ensure that you unregister a block style after it has already been registered. The best way to do this is to add it inside a function callback on `wp.domReady`, which ensures that you unregister after the DOM has loaded.

To unregister the `hand-drawn` block style that you registered via JavaScript, add this to your `/assets/js/block-editor.js` file:

```javascript
wp.domReady( function () {
	wp.blocks.unregisterBlockStyle( 'core/image', 'hand-drawn' );
} );
```

You can only unregister block styles with JavaScript if they have been registered via JavaScript. If the block style was registered with PHP, you must also use PHP to unregister it. For more information, see the “Unregistering block styles with PHP” section above.

## Customizing block styles via theme.json

It’s possible to customize the design of the core WordPress block styles. This means that you might not need to add custom CSS at all to get the look you’re after.

It is also recommended to use this method if possible for your customizations because they appear in the **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Styles** interface. Plus, your theme users can make their own changes to them if desired.

Let’s try to modify the Outline style of core Button block so that it has a drop-shadow that creates a double-border effect:

[![WordPress post editor with three outlined buttons in the content canvas. Each has a solid-border drop-shadow.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/block-styles-button-outlined.png?resize=2400%2C1235&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/block-styles-button-outlined.png?ssl=1)To do this, open your `theme.json` file. You’ll need to target the `styles.blocks.core/button.variations.outline` property. It works just like any other [style that you can add via `theme.json`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles).

Try this code snippet in your `theme.json` file:

```json
{
	"version": 2,
	"styles": {
		"blocks": {
			"core/button": {
				"variations": {
					"outline": {
						"border": {
							"color": "var:preset|color|black",
							"radius": "0",
							"style": "solid",
							"width": "3px"
						},
						"shadow": "var:preset|shadow|outlined",
						"spacing": {
							"padding": {
								"top": "0.5rem",
								"bottom": "0.5rem",
								"left": "1.5rem",
								"right": "1.5rem"
							}
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Feel free to adjust that and customize it to your liking. Then have fun modifying other block styles.

It is not currently possible to customize your custom-registered block styles via `theme.json`. You can only style those registered by core WordPress at the moment. For more information, check out the related [feature request on GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/49602).

The following are the core WordPress blocks and their styles that you can customize via `theme.json`:

- **`core/button`:** `outline`, `fill`
- **`core/image`:** `rounded`
- **`core/quote`:** `plain`
- **`core/site-logo`:** `rounded`
- **`core/separator`:** `wide`, `dots`
- **`core/social-links`:** `logos-only`, `pill-shape`
- **`core/table`:** `stripes`
- **`core/tag-cloud`**: `outline`

# Block Stylesheets <a name="themes/features/block-stylesheets" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/features/block-stylesheets/

When styling blocks, you should always do so via the [`theme.json` styles property](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles) if possible. This ensures that your styles have the best compatibility across the system, working alongside the default WordPress styles, those added by plugins, and user customizations.

But there are times when you simply need to step outside of what’s easily achievable via `theme.json`. For those cases, you should use WordPress’ built-in block stylesheets system.

In this article, you will learn how to register per-block stylesheets, but remember that `theme.json` should be your first choice for styling in most cases.

## Why use block stylesheets?

The primary use case for block stylesheets is when you have too much CSS to add to [`styles.blocks.{blockname}.css`](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/stylesstyles-reference/#css) in `theme.json`. This property allows you to add custom CSS, but it’s only ideal when it’s just a small bit of code. This is because you lose out on syntax highlighting and must place everything in a single line (JSON doesn’t support line breaks).

You may also be tempted to put all your custom CSS into your theme’s primary `style.css` file. That may be OK for some use cases, but the block stylesheets system often offers better performance by only loading the block’s CSS if the block is in use on a page. On the front end, it will also inline this code within the `<head>` area.

Creating separate stylesheets for individual blocks is also beneficial for larger and more complex projects that have a lot of custom CSS for many different blocks. The separation of the files makes it easier to organize and manage your code.

## Creating block stylesheets

To create custom block stylesheets, there are three steps you must take:

1. Decide on an organizational and naming scheme.
2. Write your custom CSS.
3. Register your custom block stylesheet(s).

### Organizing and naming block stylesheets

Before registering a block stylesheet, you first need to know what folder you will store your custom block stylesheets in. This can be anywhere you choose (there is no standard location), and the code below will assume you are putting block stylesheets in an `/assets/blocks` folder in your theme.

You should also decide on how you will name your CSS files. Again, there is no standard naming convention, but a good option is to use the block namespace and slug like so: `{namespace}-{slug}.css`. With this naming convention, a stylesheet for the `core/group` block would become `core-group.css`.

Here is an example structure of what this could look like with CSS files for a few core blocks:

- `assets/`
    - `blocks/`
        - `core-group.css`
        - `core-image.css`
        - `core-media-text.css`

### Adding CSS to a block stylesheet

To style a core block, the most important thing you need to know is its CSS class. This is automatically generated according to the block’s namespace and slug in the form of `.wp-block-{namespace}-{slug}`.

Here is an example of styling a block with the namespace and slug of `super/duper` would look like:

```css
.wp-block-super-duper {
	/* custom CSS goes here. */
}
```

Core WordPress blocks are an exception to this naming rule. Their namespace is `core`, but this is not included in any of the core blocks’ CSS classes. Instead, they use the `.wp-block-{slug}` format.

It’s possible for third-party block developers to change the CSS class that gets output, so this general guide may not always be true for third-party blocks. In those cases, you will want to locate the block’s CSS class in the source code.

Suppose that you wanted to add some custom styling for the core Image block, which has the namespace and slug of `core/image`. You would need to target the `.wp-block-image` class.

Let’s try creating a gradient background, which essentially acts as a *faux* border for the `<img>` element within the Image block. The goal is to create a style that looks like this:

[![WordPress post editor showing an image of palm trees with an orange-to-red gradient border.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/block-stylesheets-image-bg.jpg?resize=2048%2C923&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/block-stylesheets-image-bg.jpg?ssl=1)First, create an `/assets/blocks/core-image.css` file in your theme. Then, add this CSS code to it:

```css
.wp-block-image img {
	padding: 1rem;
	background: linear-gradient(-60deg,#ff5858,#f09819);
}
```

Because this stylesheet isn’t registered, your custom styles won’t show in the editor or on the front end yet.

### Registering a block stylesheet

To register your block stylesheet, you will use the [`wp_enqueue_block_style()`](#reference/functions/wp_enqueue_block_style) function. When registering block stylesheets, you should also execute the code on the `init` hook.

The `wp_enqueue_block_style()` function accepts two parameters:

- **`$block_name`:** The block name, including both the namespace and slug (e.g., `core/image`).
- **`$args`:** An array of arguments that is passed to [`wp_register_style()`](#reference/functions/wp_register_style): 
    - **`handle`:** A unique handle for your stylesheet.
    - **`src`:** The source URL for the stylesheet.
    - **`path`:** The directory path for the stylesheet (needed to inline the CSS in `<head>`).
    - **`deps`:** An array of registered stylesheet handles this stylesheet depends on.
    - **`ver`:** A custom stylesheet version number.
    - **`media`**: The media for which the stylesheet has been defined.

To register your custom stylesheet for the Image block, add this code to your `functions.php` file:

```php
add_action( 'init', 'themeslug_enqueue_block_styles' );

function themeslug_enqueue_block_styles() {
	wp_enqueue_block_style( 'core/image', array(
		'handle' => 'themeslug-block-image',
		'src'    => get_theme_file_uri( "assets/blocks/core-image.css" ),
		'path'   => get_theme_file_path( "assets/blocks/core-image.css" )
	) );
}
```

You can also configure additional arguments for your call to `wp_enqueue_block_style()`, but the above is the minimum needed for WordPress to inline your CSS code in the `<head>` area of the site.

For a deeper dive into block stylesheets, check out [Leveraging theme.json and per-block styles for more performant themes](#news/2022/12/leveraging-theme-json-and-per-block-styles-for-more-performant-themes) on the WordPress Developer Blog.

# Block Variations <a name="themes/features/block-variations" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/features/block-variations/

The Block Variations API is a powerful feature that allows you to extend any registered blocks. Basically, it gives you the ability to create alternate versions of a block’s settings. This can make it easier for your users to insert blocks without the hassle of going through all of the setup they might need for a specific scenario.

The [Block Variations API](#block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-variations) is often pitched as a plugin developer API. In many cases, plugins are the best place for variations to live. But there are also use cases for theme creators.

Several WordPress features use the term “variations” in their name. This can be confusing at times. The biggest thing to note is that block variations are not the same thing as [global style variations](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/style-variations) and [block style variations](#themes/features/block-style-variations).

## What are block variations?

The simplest explanation of block variations is that they are literally variations on an existing block. Let’s take a look at an example to explore this further.

The Social Icon block is a simple block to add a link to some social site, but WordPress bundles many different variations of this base block to cover a wide range of social sites:

[![WordPress post editor with several social icons shown in a row.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/block-variations-social-icons.jpg?resize=2048%2C924&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/block-variations-social-icons.jpg?ssl=1)Without the Block Variations API, each of those variations would need to be individually-coded blocks. There are many reasons that would be a bad idea. So instead of writing a block for each social icon, developers only need to make a few configuration changes to create an alternate version of the original block.

There are many, many ways that you could potentially change a block to make it different from its default configuration. This can be something as simple as setting up a Spacer block with your theme’s preferred default spacing. Or it can be as complex as a custom Query Loop block with a complex posts query for the front-page template.

While it is more advanced than some theme features, the API does give you the flexibility to make more complex themes than what is available out of the box.

### Block variations vs. block styles

An oft-repeated question is: *When should I create a block variation vs. a block style?*

The answer is almost always the same as the answer to another question: *Can these changes be made through* [*`theme.json` styles*](https://developers.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/styles/) *or CSS?* If yes, you should almost always create a custom [block style](https://developers.wordpress.org/themes/features/block-style-variations/).

But if you need to change a block’s settings so that it is set up differently when a user inserts an instance of it into a post, a custom block variation is probably the best route to take.

## Working with block variations

Block variations require that you work with JavaScript instead of PHP. The examples below do not require a build process, so you can use them as-is.

But the more you work with WordPress’ JavaScript packages, the more likely you’ll want to incorporate build tools into your workflow. It’s possible to use the [`@wordpress/scripts`](#block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts) package, originally meant block development, with your theme. For a deeper dive into how this works, read [Beyond block styles, part 1: using the WordPress scripts package with themes](#news/2023/07/beyond-block-styles-part-1-using-the-wordpress-scripts-package-with-themes).

In the next sections, you will learn how to work with block variations by building a simple variation on the WordPress Spacer block, as shown in this screenshot:

[![WordPress post editor with a Table of Contents block, Spacer block, and demo content.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/variation-theme-spacer.jpg?resize=2048%2C1072&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/variation-theme-spacer.jpg?ssl=1)For a deeper dive into block variations, check out these tutorials on the WordPress Developer Blog:

- [An introduction to block variations](#news/2023/08/an-introduction-to-block-variations)
- [Building a book review grid with a Query Loop block variation](#news/2022/12/building-a-book-review-grid-with-a-query-loop-block-variation)

### Setup: Loading JavaScript

The first step for working with block variations is to create an empty file for adding your custom JavaScript to. This can be at any location you choose, but the code example below will attempt to find a `block-variations.js` in your theme’s `/assets/js` folder.

So your theme structure should look similar to this:

- `/assets`
    - `/js`
        - `/block-variations.js`
- …other files and folders

To load that file in the editor, you must call the [`wp_enqueue_script()`](#reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script) function within a callback added to the [`enqueue_block_editor_assets`](#reference/hooks/enqueue_block_editor_assets) action hook.

Add this code to your theme’s `functions.php` file:

```php
add_action( 'enqueue_block_editor_assets', 'themeslug_enqueue_block_variations' );

function themeslug_enqueue_block_variations() {
	wp_enqueue_script(
		'themeslug-block-variations',
		get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/js/block-variations.js' ),
		array( 
			'wp-blocks', 
			'wp-dom-ready',
			'wp-i18n'
		),
		wp_get_theme()->get( 'Version' ),
		true
	);
}
```

Take note of the dependencies array (third parameter) within `wp_enqueue_script()`. This includes the `wp-blocks`, `wp-dom-ready`, and `wp-i18n` scripts, which are needed for the JavaScript code in the below examples.

### Registering block variations

To register block variations, you must use the `registerBlockVariation()` JavaScript function. Here is a look at the function’s signature:

```javascript
const registerBlockVariation = ( blockName, variation )
```

The function accepts two parameters:

- **`blockName`:** The name of the block (including namespace) to register the variation for.
- **`variation`:** An optional object for configuring the variation, which may include any of the following properties: 
    - **`name`:** A unique, machine-readable slug for your variation.
    - **`title`:** A human-readable title for your variation that should be internationalized.
    - **`description`:** A human-readable description of the variation that should be internationalized if added.
    - **`category`:** The slug of a registered block type category
    - **`keywords`:** An array of keywords to help users discover the variation when searching.
    - **`icon`:** An icon to use to visualize the variation. Either a string or object is accepted.
    - **`attributes`:** An object that overrides the block’s attributes.
    - **`innerBlocks`**: An array to handle the initial configuration of nested blocks.
    - **`example`:** An object that provides structured data for the block preview. Can be set to `undefined` to disable the preview.
    - **`scope`:** A list of scopes where the block can be used. Available options are: `block`, `inserter`, and `transform`.
    - **`isDefault`:** Whether to set the variation as the default variation of the block. Defaults to `false`.
    - **`isActive`:** A function or array of block attributes used to determine if the variation is active when the block is selected.

To learn more about block variations, read the [Block Variations API](#block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-variations) documentation in the Block Editor Handbook.

To build your custom variation, the most important thing is to think about the attributes that you want to control that will set this variation apart from the default block. That’s what makes a variation a *variation*.

For Spacer block variations, this is likely to be the `height` attribute. Suppose you wanted it to have a default of `180px`. For your variation, you’d need to set `attributes.height` and also check if `180px` is the value of the attribute in the `isActive` callback function.

Try this by pasting this code in your `block-variations.js` file:

```javascript
const { registerBlockVariation } = wp.blocks;
const { __ } = wp.i18n;

registerBlockVariation( 'core/spacer', {
	name:       'themeslug/spacer',
	title:      __( 'Theme Name: Spacer', 'themeslug' ),
	keywords:   [ 'space', 'spacer', 'spacing' ],
	attributes: {
		height: '180px'
	},
	isActive: ( blockAttributes ) =>
		blockAttributes.height && '180px' === blockAttributes.height
} );
```

Each block will have its own attributes, so you will need to dive into the block’s code to determine all of the available attributes you may want to overwrite for your variations. That is something beyond what can be covered in this doc, but the above code block should give you a solid starting point.

### Unregistering block variations

To unregister a block variation, you must use the `unregisterBlockVariation()` JavaScript function. Here is a look at the function’s signature:

```javascript
const unregisterBlockVariation = ( blockName, variationName )
```

The function accepts two parameters:

- **`blockName`:** The name of the block (including namespace) for the variation you want to unregister.
- **`variationName`:** The name of the variation to unregister.

Suppose that you wanted to remove the Spacer block variation that you just added from the previous section. All you need to do is plug in the block and variation names.

Add this code at the end of your `block-variations.js` file to test it:

```javascript
wp.domReady( () => {
	wp.blocks.unregisterBlockVariation( 
		'core/spacer', 
		'themeslug/spacer' 
	);
} );
```

One important thing to note when unregistering variations is that you should wrap them in a `wp.domReady()` call. This is to ensure that the unregistering process happens later in the loading process after variations have already been registered.

# Who Is This Handbook For? <a name="themes/getting-started/who-is-this-handbook-for" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/who-is-this-handbook-for/

The Theme Developer Handbook is a self-contained resource to help you learn the fundamental principles of creating a WordPress theme. It covers a range of topics that span the basics to advanced development.

You should read this handbook if you want to:

- Create a theme based on nothing but your imagination
- Build a new theme based on an existing one
- Extend another theme by creating a child theme
- Understand how themes work

Regardless of your reasons for starting down this adventure, this handbook will help you take the next steps toward building a WordPress theme of your own.

## Your skill level

While not a strict requirement, you will get the most out of this handbook if you have a baseline understanding and some experience with web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and PHP. JavaScript knowledge would be a bonus if you plan to add interactivity to the front end.

Present-day WordPress and its block theme system allow you to customize and export a theme directly from the Site Editor interface:

[![WordPress Site Editor with the options menu dropdown open on the right. The Export option is highlighted.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/twenty-twenty-three-export.jpg?resize=2400%2C1250&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/twenty-twenty-three-export.jpg?ssl=1)Exporting a variation of the core Twenty Twenty-Three theme.With each major WordPress update, its visual building tools become even more robust. Still, having some basic HTML, CSS, and PHP knowledge will help you move along faster.

Unlike block themes, [classic themes](#themes/classic-themes) are built entirely from code. This requires that you be comfortable enough to edit one or more of those languages to some degree.

The [Reading this handbook](#themes/getting-started/reading-this-handbook) page has more information on the prerequisite knowledge you need to build themes.

At the very least, you must be able to set up and configure a website using WordPress. Otherwise, you won’t be able to test or use the theme that you are building. You can learn more about getting things running in the [Tools and setup](#themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup) documentation.

## What this handbook covers

This handbook provides the basic information you need to build both block and classic WordPress themes. This includes in-depth coverage of the essential features and APIs that you should know, such as the topics in the [Core Concepts](#themes/core-concepts) chapter. It also dives into tools and techniques for building more advanced themes in the [Advanced Topics](#themes/advanced-topics) chapter.

WordPress is a vast subject. HTML, CSS, PHP, accessibility, and other web technologies are even larger. It’d be impossible to cover every aspect of building a website in this handbook alone. Therefore, it is highly-focused on the fundamentals of theme building.

The goal of this handbook is to give you a solid foundation for WordPress theme creation by providing step-by-step instructions for building basic themes and providing resources to further your skills.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, come along. You’re in for a journey.

# Reading This Handbook <a name="themes/getting-started/reading-this-handbook" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/reading-this-handbook/

The goal of this handbook is to walk you through the basics of modern WordPress theme development in its early chapters. Then, work through more advanced topics with each chapter that follows.

The quickest way to learn theme development is to simply read this handbook from beginning to end and follow along with its examples.

## Requirements

The biggest requirement for building a WordPress theme is a willingness to learn. You are here reading this handbook, so let’s check that one off the list of requirements.

WordPress theming has changed many times over the years. Today, the pathway for creating one is much lower than it was in the past. You can absolutely create a theme with no coding knowledge. But you will find it much easier to familiarize yourself with a few web languages.

You will see HTML, CSS, PHP, JSON, and JavaScript within the handbook, so it helps to be able to easily recognize what language you are looking at. HTML and CSS are foundational pieces of the web, so those should be prioritized over others.

The following are external resources that you can use to learn more, but there are 1,000s of guides and tutorials around the web:

- [MDN Web Docs: HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [MDN Web Docs: CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [PHP official documentation](https://www.php.net/docs.php)
- [MDN Web Docs: JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON)
- [MDN Web Docs: JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

You can get pretty far into theme building via the WordPress user interface, at least by modifying and exporting an existing block theme. But you’ll want to pick up a few more skills to build more advanced features, or to truly create a theme from scratch.

## Your next steps

### For newcomers

It is time to truly embark on your journey into learning theme development. It is an exciting moment, so get ready for an adventure.

**Setting things up:** if this is your first time building a theme, or if you just want a refresher on the basics of theme development, your next stop should be the [Tools and Setup](#themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup) page. This will help you set up your development environment and determine which tools you need to start off on the right foot.

**Getting off to a quick start:** once you’re set up, check out the [Quick-start guide](#themes/getting-started/quick-start-guide), which is aimed at giving you a taste of what’s to come. It will walk you through setting up a theme to work with.

**Understanding the basics:** once you have everything set up and running, move onto the [Core Concepts](#themes/core-concepts) chapter. There, you will learn the foundational principles behind creating WordPress themes.

Afterward, just keep working through each chapter of the handbook.

### For seasoned theme authors

Even if you’ve been creating themes for years, it never hurts to give the full handbook a reading from time to time. It is regularly updated, so there may be new content that you haven’t seen before.

Feel free to hop around to find the specific topic you need using the handbook’s navigation links. Whatever the case, the Theme Handbook is here to help you discover a solution.

*Feeling pretty hardcore?* Jump over to the [Advanced Topics](#themes/advanced-topics) chapter.

*Can’t remember the naming format for a particular template?* Find it in the [Template Hierarchy](#themes/templates/template-hierarchy) docs.

*Need to brush up on `theme.json`?* No problem. Check out the [Global Settings and Styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles) documentation.

You can also find theming tutorials and walk-throughs under the [Themes category](#news/category/themes) on the WordPress Developer blog if you can’t find the topic you’re looking for in the handbook.

### For classic themes documentation

While some of the content in most chapters will apply to classic themes, the docs are primarily geared toward modern block theming. However, there is a dedicated [Classic Themes](#themes/classic-themes) chapter if you need to locate documentation on a specific classic feature.

## How to read code examples

Throughout the handbook, you will see code examples, and this section is aimed at helping you understand how to read them.

The handbook will use a consistent “namespace” or “prefix” throughout its pages, generally seen as `theme_slug` or `theme-slug`. This namespace is meant to be replaced in your theme with one that is unique to it.

*But how do you know what your namespace is?* The most straightforward way is to use your theme’s name. If your theme is titled **Fabled Sunset**, you would convert it to the appropriate format for the use case. For example, it would become `fabled_sunset` when used in a PHP function name or `fabled-sunset` as a handle/slug/ID.

The practice of “namespacing” code is decades old. Essentially, a namespace is an identifier for a group of objects created so that they do not conflict with objects in other namespaces.

WordPress has a vast ecosystem of plugins and themes. Each needs a way to distinguish itself from the others. Without unique namespaces, it would get a bit chaotic and errors would arise.

For example, if your theme declared a custom function named `get_post()` instead of `fabled_sunset_get_post()`, your site would fail with a fatal error because WordPress already has a function with this name:

[![Screenshot of an error message stating that you cannot redeclare the get_post() function, which was already declared.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/fatal-error.jpg?resize=1760%2C824&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/fatal-error.jpg?ssl=1)Avoiding these types of errors is the primary reason the handbook will include namespaced or prefixed code examples.

### Namespacing examples

Using the fictional theme name **Fabled Sunset**, let’s look at some examples of formatting your namespace. Don’t worry if you don’t understand these yet or if you do not know anything about code. This is only meant to help you read the handbook.

**Usage in script and style handles:**

```php
<?php
// theme-slug-editor becomes:
wp_enqueue_script( 'fabled-sunset-editor', ... );

// theme-slug-main becomes:
wp_enqueue_style( 'fabled-sunset-main', ... );
```

**Usage in text domains (used for translations):**

```php
<?php
// theme-slug becomes:
esc_html_e( 'Hello, world!', 'fabled-sunset' );
```

**Usage in PHP Functions:**

```php
<?php
// theme_slug_func() becomes:
function fabled_sunset_func() {
	// ...
}
```

**Usage in PHP classes:**

```php
<?php
// Theme_Slug_Class() becomes:
class Fabled_Sunset_Class() {
	// ...
}
```

As you read through the handbook, you will learn when to use each case. For now, just know that you should always replace the example namespace with one that is unique to your project.

The WordPress Coding Standards [encourages the use of PHP’s built-in namespaces](#coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php). The same guideline would apply: use your theme’s name to create your namespace. In this case, the namespace for the example theme would be `Fabled_Sunset` or `FabledSunset`. The Theme Handbook uses a prefixed style for PHP function and class names, as shown above. This is primarily because it is simpler for showing one-off code examples.

# Tools and Setup <a name="themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup/

In this document, you will learn about the tools that you will need to get off to a solid start when building WordPress themes. You will also find resources on setting up a development environment for testing your projects.

While it is definitely possible to create and build block themes without any of these tools, they are foundational pieces of a good workflow.

## Development environment

When building WordPress themes, it is a good idea to do it within an environment that is separate from a live (i.e., production) site. Before creating your first WordPress theme, you should set up a development environment.

Don’t let this process scare you if it’s your first time. In the long run, you will be happy you learned how to set this up.

### Why set up a development environment?

Development environments allow you to test code before it goes live on a production site. You don’t want to change something, push it live, and later realize you created a fatal error that took down the whole website.

By using a development environment, you can test things to ensure they work before they are live.

Your development environment can either be local (on your computer) or on a remote server. But configuring a local environment to work on your theme is beneficial for several reasons:

- You do not need an internet connection to build your theme.
- You can build your theme without relying on a remote server. This speeds up the building process, and you can see changes instantly in your browser.
- You can test your theme from many perspectives. This is important if you plan on releasing it to a larger audience and want maximum compatibility.

### Setting up a local development environment

For developing WordPress themes, you need to set up a development environment that is suited to WordPress. This list is not exhaustive, but here are several options to choose from:

- [@wordpress/env](#block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-env) (local WordPress environment package)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Local](https://localwp.com/)
- [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp/mac/)
- [Studio](https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/)
- [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/) (VVV)
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)

For more information, read the [Setting Up a Development Environment](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-a-local-server/) documentation in the Core Handbook.

## Installing WordPress

Before you begin building themes in your development environment, you must also install WordPress.

Some of the development environments include methods for automatically installing an instance of WordPress. You can skip this step if this is the case for you.

To install WordPress on your own, follow the [How to install WordPress](#advanced-administration/before-install/howto-install) documentation from the Advanced Administration handbook. Then, of course, come back here and learn more about creating WordPress themes!

## Code editor

> *A good code editor is worth its weight in gold.*
> 
> Someone Wise

On a more serious note, a good code editor gives you proper syntax highlighting, error reporting, integration with version control systems (VCS), and much more. It’s there to make your life easier.

Technically, you could edit code in a plain text editor, but you’d be missing out on all the best features that true code editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) bring to life.

[![Visual Studio Code editor program with a theme's single.html file open, showing block markup.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/vs-code-editor.png?resize=2757%2C1497&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/vs-code-editor.png?ssl=1)Editing a theme’s `single.html` template in Visual Studio CodeThere are many free and open-source editors to choose from. Here are some of the more popular ones:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code)
- [VIM](https://www.vim.org/)
- [Brackets](https://brackets.io/)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
- [TextMate](https://macromates.com/)

There are also many proprietary editors that are free or cost a fee to use. Whatever you decide to use, pick something you feel comfortable with.

## Other development tools

A code editor and development environment are the foundational pieces of creating a WordPress theme. However, there are other tools and resources that you will likely find useful for your project.

### Test data

WordPress allows you to [import XML files](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/importing-content/) containing real or dummy data for testing your themes. This lets you see how your theme performs with different types of content and layouts. Here are two options for importing:

- [WordPress.org Theme Test Data](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test)
- [WordPress.com Theme Test Data](http://themetest.wordpress.com/) *(includes WordPress.com-specific data)*

If nothing else, you need some type of demo/test content to see what your theme looks like in action. You could even create test posts and pages of your own!

### Plugins

In addition to test data, there are several WordPress plugins that can help make sure your theme is following standard practices and not producing debugging notices. These are optional but can be useful:

- [Theme Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/): Tests your theme for compliance with the latest WordPress standards and practices.
- [Debug Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/): Adds an admin bar to your WordPress admin and provides a central location for debugging.
- [Query Monitor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/): Allows debugging of database queries, API requests, and AJAX used to generate theme pages and functionality.
- [Log Deprecated Notices](https://wordpress.org/plugins/log-deprecated-notices/): Logs incorrect function usage, deprecated file usage, and deprecated function usage in your theme.
- [Monster Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/monster-widget/): Consolidates the core WordPress widgets into a single widget, making it easier to test them all at once (*classic themes only*).

## WordPress.org Theme Review Guidelines

It is a good idea to stay up to date with the [theme guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/) provided by the WordPress.org Themes Team. These guidelines are required if you plan to submit your theme to the official [Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes), but they are also good principles for anyone creating a theme.

You should also follow the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/) when writing any code for your theme. This will help make sure what you are creating meets some minimum quality standards.

# Quick-Start Guide <a name="themes/getting-started/quick-start-guide" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/quick-start-guide/

The first step is always the hardest to take. Now that you’ve made it this far into the Getting Started chapter, you’ve already taken several steps. Congratulations on getting through all of the necessary setup.

In a way, actually building your first theme can feel like another first step, but you are ready to trek out into the wilderness and beyond. Don’t worry—this guide will walk with you as you set out on this journey.

## Activating your first theme

One of the best ways to understand how to build themes is to look at and study existing themes.

Even in advanced development circles, one of the cornerstones of sound development is to reuse code. This is because developers understand that this is the most efficient way to get things done, and many try to abide by the “don’t reinvent the wheel” mantra.

Regardless of whether you are a developer, this is sound advice. You don’t need to build everything from scratch. There’s a good chance that most of what you want to do has already been created by someone else.

So, your next step is to activate an existing theme.

### Choosing a theme to learn from

Packaged in every version of WordPress since version 3.0 (and named after the year they were released in), the default themes are some of the best to study how themes are built. This is because they are designed with broad use in mind and fully adhere to WordPress coding standards.

Because this handbook primarily focuses on modern, block theming, you should choose one of the newest default themes:

- [Twenty Twenty-Four](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfour/)
- [Twenty Twenty-Three](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/)
- [Twenty Twenty-Two](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/)

It’s typically best to use the latest default theme. This is because it will be built with the most up-to-date features in mind. Plus, it should already be activated if you’ve recently installed WordPress:

[![WordPress Appearance > Theme admin screen, showing the Twenty Twenty-Four theme activated.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt4-activated.jpg?resize=2048%2C1064&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt4-activated.jpg?ssl=1)You can also choose any theme from the official [Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/) to learn from, but for the purposes of this guide, it should be a [block theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/). For more information on installing and activating themes, read the [Work with themes](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/work-with-themes/) documentation.

If your interests lie in classic WordPress, you should jump forward to the [Classic Themes](#themes/classic-themes) chapter for more details on building classic themes.

## Customizing your theme

Once you’ve activated a block theme, take some time to simply have fun exploring and tinkering with the available options in the [Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/). Essentially, this is an editable, visual representation of your theme in the WordPress admin.

And, as promised earlier in the Getting Started chapter, you can build your theme entirely from this interface without touching a single line of code.

You can locate the Site Editor via **Appearance &gt; Editor** in the WordPress admin menu. Once opened, your screen should look similar to this:

[![WordPress Site Editor with the Design menu shown in the left panel. In the preview panel is the homepage of the Twenty Twenty-Four theme.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt4-editor.jpg?resize=2048%2C1064&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt4-editor.jpg?ssl=1)There are a lot of pieces to this, and you can find yourself lost for hours just tinkering around in the Site Editor. It can be fun, and you’ll learn more about how this integrates with your theme as you read through this handbook. For now, let’s get to the basics of “creating” a theme.

This part of the journey can be entirely self-directed, so feel free to do this at your own pace and in your own way. But most people will want to begin by adjusting their design.

You can do this by first selecting the **Styles** item in the menu panel:

[![WordPress Styles screen under the Site Editor in the admin. The left panel shows several style variation options.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt4-styles.jpg?resize=2048%2C1064&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt4-styles.jpg?ssl=1)The Twenty Twenty-Four theme (and many other block themes) include pre-designed style variations, which you can see in the sidebar in the above screenshot. You will learn more about these variations in the [Global Settings and Styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles) chapter, but feel free to use one as a starting point for your own customizations.

The next step is to select the **Style Book** icon (it looks like an eye). Opening this screen will give you full access to modifying the global styles of the site:

[![Style Book screen under the WordPress Site Editor in the admin. It shows a tabbed overlay with various blocks.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt4-style-book.jpg?resize=2048%2C1064&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt4-style-book.jpg?ssl=1)At this point, *the world is your oyster*—in other words, feel free to let your creativity run wild. But most importantly, get a feel for what settings and styles are available in the interface. This familiarity will come in hand as you dive into more advanced sections of the handbook.

For a deeper dive into using the Style Book, read this guide from the WordPress Developer Blog: [The Style Book: a one-stop shop for styling block themes](#news/2023/06/the-style-book-a-one-stop-shop-for-styling-block-themes).

## Exporting your theme

Once you’ve customized the theme to your liking, be sure to hit the **Save** button. When you’re ready, you will “create” your first theme.

You have two options for doing this. The first is to use the built-in exporter from the Site Editor in WordPress. The second is to use the [Create Block Theme](https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/) plugin, which has more extensive options available. There are instructions for both methods below.

### Exporting from the Styles interface

To export your theme from the Site Editor interface, click the **⋮ (Options)** button in the header area. You will see a dropdown of available options. Click the **Export** option, as shown below:

[![WordPress Site Editor with the Options menu dropdown open. The Export option is highlighted.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt4-export.jpg?resize=2048%2C1064&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt4-export.jpg?ssl=1)This will give you a ZIP file with your complete theme in it. The filename will match that of the theme you were working from. In the case of the default Twenty Twenty-Four theme, it will be `twentytwentyfour.zip`.

***Congratulations!*** You have now successfully created your first WordPress theme.

You were assured that you could create a theme without touching code. That was the truth. You have built a theme that can be uploaded to any WordPress website just like any other theme.

But there was a *fib*—a harmless white lie—mixed in with that truth about there being no code involved.

The theme you downloaded is still named “Twenty Twenty-Four,” and it’s best to rename it so that it’s representative of what you’ve created. To do this, unzip the `twentytwentyfour.zip` folder and rename it to `your-theme-name`.

Then, open the `style.css` file within that folder. You should see something like this at the top of the file:

```css
/*
Theme Name: Twenty Twenty-Four
Theme URI: https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfour/
Author: the WordPress team
Author URI: https://wordpress.org
...
```

At the very least, you should adjust those first four lines, particularly the `Theme Name` value. And that’s all the code you *really* have to touch.

As a final step, zip the file again with whatever utility program you have on your computer for creating ZIP files.

### Using the Create Block Theme plugin

The [Create Block Theme](https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/) plugin is an official, first-party plugin that WordPress contributors maintain. Often, you will see new ideas for exporting themes tried and tested here before they land in WordPress.

The plugin is more robust than what you will find in core WordPress, meaning that it has many more options for exporting your theme. This guide will only cover the basics of exporting your theme, but feel free to explore the plugin’s features in more detail.

Once you’ve activated Create Block Theme, you should see a new button in the Site Editor that is displayed as a wrench icon. Click this button to open the **Create Block Theme** menu.

You will see several options for saving changes, exporting a ZIP, editing theme info, and creating a new theme:

[![WordPress Site Editor with a "tool" icon in the top right. A menu is open titled "Create Block Theme" and has several options.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt4-create-block-theme-menu.jpg?resize=2048%2C1064&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt4-create-block-theme-menu.jpg?ssl=1)You can use the **Export ZIP** option to export the theme as you did earlier.

But Create Block Theme offers more customization options that you’ll want to use for truly creating a custom theme. Click on the **Create Theme** option:

[![WordPress Site Editor with the Create Block Theme > Create Theme menu open. Several fields are shown within the menu panel.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt4-create-block-theme-customize.jpg?resize=2048%2C1064&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt4-create-block-theme-customize.jpg?ssl=1)From there, you’ll be able to customize all of the information about your theme to make it unique. Once finished, click the **Export Theme** button for your new theme.

The one thing that Create Block Theme does not yet do is let you upload a custom screenshot. You’ll still need to add a unique `screenshot.[png|jpg]` file in your theme if you intend to distribute to others.

# Core Concepts <a name="themes/core-concepts" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/core-concepts/

Welcome to the Core Concepts documentation. The goal of this chapter is to introduce you to the foundational concepts necessary for creating your own WordPress block themes.

The focus of this chapter is to help you familiarize yourself with the basic theme structure and standard files like `style.css`, `functions.php`, and `theme.json`. Once you have these core concepts down, you can more comfortably dive into the later chapters in this handbook.

## Navigating this chapter

Use the following links to locate a topic within this chapter. Each article is listed in the recommended reading order for those new to theme development. For those with existing experience creating themes, feel free to jump to the section you need:

- [**Theme Structure**](#themes/core-concepts/theme-structure)**:** Walks through how a theme’s files and folders are structured following WordPress standards.
- [**Main Stylesheet**](#themes/core-concepts/main-stylesheet)**:** Explains the importance of the theme’s `style.css` file and how to use it.
- [**Custom Functionality**](#themes/core-concepts/custom-functionality)**:** Dives into the theme’s functions file (`functions.php`) and how you can use it to add your own functionality to a theme.
- [**Templates**](#themes/core-concepts/templates)**:** Introduces how WordPress’ block templates system works and provides pathways for deeper learning.
- [**Including Assets**](#themes/core-concepts/including-assets)**:** A guide on including CSS, JavaScript, images, and more in your themes.
- [**Global Settings and Styles**](#themes/core-concepts/global-settings-and-styles)**:** Gives a basic overview of how the `theme.json` file works in themes with learning pathways to more detailed articles.

# Theme Structure <a name="themes/core-concepts/theme-structure" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/core-concepts/theme-structure/

In the [Getting Started](#themes/getting-started) chapter, you learned the basics of what a theme is and how to get one up and running without code. A no-code approach is perfectly OK for simple themes, but once you want to add things that are not possible in the user interface, you’ll need to start working directly with code.

The first step of customizing theme code is to open the theme in your preferred file editor. You can use any theme for this, even the one you created from the Getting Started chapter.

It’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with what others are doing, so feel free to look at several [block themes](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/) from the WordPress theme directory.

This document will walk you through what the file and folder structure will look like in a typical block theme.

## Files and folders

WordPress themes are nothing more than a collection of various files that rely on different web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and PHP. Block themes also follow a standard structure in how many of those files are laid out.

At its most basic, a theme’s structure will look similar to the following. Take note of the files/folders marked **required** because they are necessary for a block theme to work:

- `parts/`
    - `footer.html`
    - `header.html`
- `patterns/`
    - `example.php`
- `styles/`
    - `example.json`
- `templates/`
    - `404.html`
    - `archive.html`
    - `index.html` (required)
    - `singular.html`
- `README.txt`
- `functions.php`
- `screenshot.png`
- `style.css` (required)
- `theme.json`

### Required files

There are two necessary files for WordPress to recognize your block theme, and you will learn more about these in the coming documentation:

- **`style.css`** ([Main Stylesheet](#themes/core-concepts/main-stylesheet)): This file is required for configuring theme data, such as its name and description. It can also be used for adding custom CSS.
- **`templates/index.html`** ([Templates](#themes/core-concepts/templates)): The default/fallback template. This is necessary for WordPress to consider this a block theme.

### Optional files

A theme can include any number of custom files other than the required list above. WordPress also looks for a few other files and uses them if they are available:

- **`README.txt`** ([Theme Review: Files](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/#9-files)): This is not used directly by the WordPress software. But it is a required file when submitting a theme to the official WordPress theme directory, meant to provide information about the theme to users.
- **`functions.php`** ([Custom Functionality](#themes/core-concepts/custom-functionality)): A PHP file that WordPress automatically loads after the theme is initialized during the page-loading process. You can use it to run custom PHP.
- **`screenshot.png`**: A 1200×900 screenshot image of your theme. Used for displaying your theme under **Appearance &gt; Themes** in the WordPress admin and in the WordPress theme directory (if submitted there). Both `.png` and `.jpg` are acceptable file formats.
- **`theme.json`** ([Global Settings and Styles](#themes/core-concepts/global-settings-and-styles)): Used to configure settings and styles for the site, integrating with the user interface.

### Standard folders

In the example above, there were a few folders included. A theme can have many more folders, but WordPress has designated a few of them for specific features. You will learn more about these folders as you read through this chapter:

- **`parts`** ([Template Parts](#themes/templates/template-parts)): Houses custom template parts for your theme. Parts are smaller sections that you can include within top-level templates. Often, this will include things like headers, footers, and sidebars.
- **`patterns`** ([Block Patterns](#themes/features/block-patterns)): Reusable patterns made up of one or more blocks that users can insert via the editor interface. WordPress will automatically register files included in this folder.
- **`styles`** ([Style Variations](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/style-variations)): Variations on the theme’s global settings and styles stored in individual JSON files.
- **`templates`** ([Templates](#themes/templates/templates)): Files that represent the overall document structure of the front-end. Templates are made up of block markup and are what site visitors see.

## Advanced theme structure

This section is meant to familiarize you with some of the common files you’ll see in themes but not to cover every possibility in detail. These files are entirely optional and will differ from theme to theme. You may skip this section for now if you are not comfortable with more advanced development methods.

In reality, block themes can contain many more files and folders. The more complex the project becomes, the more complex its structure will be.

Let’s add a few extra files and folders to the original example:

- `assets/`
    - `css/`
        - `core-site-title.css`
    - `images/`
        - `header-background.png`
    - `js/`
        - `navigation.js`
- `inc/`
    - `ClassName.php`
    - `functions-helpers.php`
- `parts/`
    - `footer.html`
    - `header.html`
- `patterns/`
    - `example.php`
- `styles/`
    - `example.jso`n
- `templates/`
    - `404.html`
    - `archive.html`
    - `index.html` (required)
    - `singular.html`
- `.editorconfig`
- `.gitattributes`
- `.gitignore`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `LICENSE.md`
- `README.txt`
- `functions.php`
- `package.json`
- `screenshot.png`
- `style.css` (required)
- `theme.json`

### Optional folders

There is no limit on what folders may be included, but the above example added two of the most common use cases you’ll come across in WordPress themes:

- **`assets`** ([Including Assets](#themes/core-concepts/including-assets)): Many theme authors use this folder to store additional CSS, Images/Media, and JavaScript needed for their theme. This folder may also have other names, such as `resources` or `public`.
- **`inc`** ([Custom Functionality](#themes/core-concepts/custom-functionality)): Themes will often have custom PHP classes or files stored in this folder for additional functionality. This folder may also be seen named as `includes`, `src`, and more.

### Optional files

This list is nowhere near exhaustive, but it includes some common files used in theme development. *(Note: most of the following links lead to external, third-party sites and are not affiliated with WordPress.)*

- **`.editorconfig`** ([EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)): Used for configuring formatting, such as line endings and spacing, for code editors.
- **`.gitattributes`** ([Git: Attributes](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes)): Configures attributes with the Git version control system.
- **`.gitignore`** ([Git: Ignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)): Defines files to ignore when committing code to a Git repository.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** ([Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)): A human-readable log of important changes for each release of your theme.
- **`LICENSE.md`** ([Theme Review: Licensing &amp; Copyright](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/#1-licensing-copyright)): Defines the license for the theme. Note that all themes submitted to the WordPress theme directory must be licensed under the GPL v2+.
- **`package.json`** ([npm: package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json/)): Often used to define a build process and development dependencies within a Node environment.

Don’t feel discouraged if you do not understand all of these files and their purposes yet. Again, these are entirely optional elements of a developer’s workflow. Feel free to learn more about them at your own pace at a later time.

### Code editor view

Here is a quick editor view of a real-world theme with an advanced structure:

[![Visual Studio Code editor showing the structure of a theme's files and folders. In the code area, a theme.json file is shown.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/theme-file-structure.png?resize=2048%2C1143&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/theme-file-structure.png?ssl=1)This is vastly more complex than the basics that this documentation is introducing. The point is that, even when building block themes following standard practices, you will have a lot of freedom to customize things. You may want to integrate with version control systems, add in a build process, and more.

So, consider this documentation the foundation in which you can build upon. But there is no harm in keeping it simple and sticking with the basics.

# Main Stylesheet (style.css) <a name="themes/core-concepts/main-stylesheet" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/core-concepts/main-stylesheet/

As described in [Theme Structure](#themes/core-concepts/theme-structure), WordPress requires that all themes include a `style.css` file. Its most important function is to “register” the theme with WordPress through configuration data at the top of the file. Many themes also use it to serve CSS to the front-end (and even the editor).

In this document, you will learn how to configure your theme data via the `style.css` file header.

## File Header

The `style.css` file header is used to configure data about the theme. WordPress uses this information to determine how some features work and displays some of this data under the **Appearance &gt; Themes** screen for users.

Here is a look at what the theme details overlay looks like for the default Twenty Twenty-Three theme:

[![WordPress themes screen with the Twenty Twenty-Three modal overlay over the screen. It shows the theme screenshot, description, and metadata.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt3-theme-details.jpg?resize=2048%2C1002&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt3-theme-details.jpg?ssl=1)Most of that information is pulled directly from the `style.css` file header. It is one of the most vital parts of creating a WordPress theme.

When determining which themes are available to activate, WordPress searches through each folder under `/wp-content/themes`, looking for a `style.css` file. If one is found, it pulls the first 8kb of data from the file and determines if there is a file header with standard fields defined.

In themes, this is merely a CSS comment block with some standard keys and values defined.

Suppose you were creating a theme with the folder name of `fabled-sunset`. WordPress would look for your theme’s `style.css` in the following location:

- `wp-content/`
    - `themes/`
        - `fabled-sunset/`
            - `style.css`

For WordPress to recognize your theme, you would at least need the `Theme Name` field defined at the top of `style.css` like so:

```css
/**
 * Theme Name: Fabled Sunset
 */
```

This is the minimum required header field for a valid theme. Of course, you’ll want to add much more information about your theme.

### Header fields

There are many supported fields, and you will likely use most of them in your themes. Here is a quick look at a theme’s `style.css` file header with each of the fields configured:

```css
/**
 * Theme Name:        Fabled Sunset
 * Theme URI:         https://example.com/fabled-sunset
 * Description:       Custom theme description...
 * Version:           1.0.0
 * Author:            Your Name
 * Author URI:        https://example.com
 * Tags:              block-patterns, full-site-editing
 * Text Domain:       fabled-sunset
 * Domain Path:       /assets/lang
 * Tested up to:      6.4
 * Requires at least: 6.2
 * Requires PHP:      7.4
 * License:           GNU General Public License v2.0 or later
 * License URI:       https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
 */
```

The following list outlines what each of these fields does.

While the `Theme Name` is the only field required to work with WordPress, you must also include some other fields when submitting a theme to the WordPress theme directory. These fields are marked with **\*** below.

- **Theme Name\*:** A unique name for your theme.
- **Theme URI:** The URL of a public web page where users can find more information about the theme.
- **Description\*:** A description of the theme, which will be displayed when viewing a theme’s details in the WordPress admin and other places. It is also used for themes submitted to the WordPress theme directory.
- **Version\*:** The version of the theme, written in `X.X` or `X.X.X` format.
- **Author\*:**  Your name or the name of the organization who developed the theme. For themes submitted to the theme directory, it is recommended to use the WordPress.org username.
- **Author URI:** The URL of the individual or organization who created the theme.
- **Tags:** A comma-separated list of features the theme supports. The Theme Review Handbook has a [list of valid tags](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/theme-tags/) for submission to the theme directory, but third-party sites may use a different system.
- **Text Domain\*:** The string used for the textdomain for translations.
- **Domain Path:** A relative path to where theme translations are stored. WordPress uses this field when the theme is disabled to detect translations. Defaults to `/languages`.
- **Tested up to\*:** The last WordPress version the theme has been tested up to, written in `X.X` format (e.g., `6.`4, `6.2.1`, etc.).
- **Requires at least\*:** The oldest WordPress version the theme will work with, written in `X.X` format (e.g., `6.3`, `6.2.1`, etc.).
- **Requires PHP\*:** The oldest PHP version the theme will work with, written in `X.X` format (e.g., `8.0`, `7.4`, etc.).
- **License\*:** The license for the theme.
- **License URI\*:** The URL of the theme’s license.

### Child theme header fields

When building a child theme, there is one additional supported field: **Template**. This is used to designate the parent theme’s folder.

If the fictional “Fabled Sunset” theme listed above was the parent of your child theme named “Grand Sunrise,” your `style.css` header fields would look similar to this:

```css
/**
 * Theme Name: Grand Sunrise
 * Template:   fabled-sunset
 * ...other header fields
 */
```

The `Template` field must match the parent theme’s folder name exactly (relative to the `wp-content/themes` directory) for this to work. Otherwise, WordPress will not be able to appropriately match them.

You can [learn more about child themes](#themes/advanced-topics/child-themes) in the Advanced Topics chapter.

### Custom header fields

Some third-party marketplaces or systems may also make use of custom header fields. These are not officially supported by WordPress, but they are definitely allowed and should not negatively impact how the theme works within WordPress.

## Custom CSS

The `style.css` file is not merely a configuration file. You can also use it to write custom CSS code to alter the design of your theme, assuming the file is properly loaded.

With block themes, most or all of the design is ideally handled through the `theme.json` file, which you will learn about in the [Global Settings and Styles](#themes/core-concepts/global-settings-and-styles) documentation.

But there are times when you will want or need to add custom CSS. You can learn more about this in the [Including Assets](#themes/core-concepts/including-assets) documentation.

# Templates <a name="themes/core-concepts/templates" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/core-concepts/templates/

In block themes, templates are made up of a collection of blocks. You might have a Site Logo block sitting next to a Navigation block in the header area. You might put Social Icons in the footer above a copyright notice.

As you build out your own themes, you will get to decide how your templates come together. *That’s at least half the fun of theming!*

In this document, you will learn the basic terminology around templating in WordPress. Reading through this quick primer on the subject will provide you with some foundational knowledge moving forward. There is a dedicated [Templates](#themes/templates) chapter that provides a full overview of working with templates.

## What are templates?

Theme templates represent the markup of the webpage. They create the document structure and print both static data (e.g., paragraph text) and dynamic data (e.g., post content) to the front end of your site.

Let’s take a look at a template from the default Twenty Twenty-Three theme.

Go to **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Templates &gt; Single Posts** in your WordPress admin. This will show you what a Single post template looks like:

[![WordPress Site Editor with a focus on the Single Post template.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt3-single-template-editor.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt3-single-template-editor.jpg?ssl=1)Single post template of the default Twenty Twenty-Three theme.As shown above, the template is made up of various blocks. Some of them are in placeholder states and will dynamically display content based on what page is being viewed on the front end of the site.

If you select the **⋮ (Options)** button in the template editor and select the **Code editor** option, you will see the block markup of the template:

[![WordPress site editor showing the Single Post template in code view, which shows the block markup.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt3-single-template-code.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt3-single-template-code.jpg?ssl=1)Code view of the default Twenty Twenty-Three theme’s single post template.

One of the great things about templating in WordPress is that you never really have to interact directly with template code. You have the visual Site Editor to make any and all customizations you want. But the code is there if you need it.

Ultimately, the template produces HTML markup on the front end like this (shortened for clarity):

```markup

<html lang="en-US">
<head>
	<title>Post Title</title>
	<!-- Scripts, styles, and meta here. -->
</head>

<body class="post-template single single-post">
	<div class="wp-site-blocks">
		<header class="wp-block-template-part">
			<!-- Header blocks here. -->
		</header>
		<main class="wp-block-group is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
			<!-- Nested blocks here. -->
		</main>
		<footer class="wp-block-template-part">
			<!-- Footer blocks here. -->
		</footer>
	</div>
</body>
</html>
```

WordPress automatically handles the final markup for you, so all you need to do is create the templates.

## How the templating system works

Whenever you visit a page on the front end of your website, WordPress must determine which template file to load. In the example above, the Single post template (`single.html`) is used to display the content of single blog posts.

But there are many other types of templates. For example, you might have a Page template (`page.html`) for displaying the content of your site’s pages or an Author template (`author.html`) for displaying post author archives.

WordPress uses the template hierarchy to determine which template file to load. It is essentially a set of rules that defines which template to use based on the web page being viewed. If a template doesn’t exist, WordPress will continue looking down through the hierarchy until it finds one that does.

If no specific template is found, it will fall back to the Index template: `index.html`. As you learned in [Theme Structure](#themes/core-concepts/theme-structure), this is the minimum required template for a block theme to function.

The [Templates](#themes/templates) chapter covers the hierarchy in full detail. There, you will learn which templates are loaded for each page of a WordPress site.

### Template files

WordPress expects template files to be located under the `/templates` folder in your theme. A typical theme will have several templates, which would be organized like this:

- `templates/`
    - `404.html`
    - `archive.html`
    - `author.html`
    - `index.html` (required)
    - `page.html`
    - `single.html`
    - `search.html`

These are some of the common templates you will find a theme:

- **`index.html`:** The fallback template file. It is required in all themes.
- **`404.html`:** The 404 template is used when WordPress cannot find a post, page, or other content that matches the visitor’s request.
- **`archive.html`:** The archive template is used when visitors request posts by archive-type views like category, author, or date and a more-specific template is unavailable.
- **`author.html`:** The author page template is used whenever a visitor loads an author archive.
- **`category.html`:** The category template is used when visitors request posts by category.
- **`page.html`:** The page template is used when visitors request individual pages.
- **`search.html`:** The search results template is used to display a visitor’s search results.
- **`single.html`:** The single post template is used when a visitor requests a single post.
- **`tag.html`:** The tag template is used when visitors request posts by tag.

This is not an exhaustive list. You will learn the ins and outs of every template file as you dive deeper into the [Templates](#themes/templates) chapter. The goal for now is to give you a baseline understanding of what to expect.

## Template parts

Template parts, or “parts” for short, are another integral part of the templating system in WordPress. As the name suggests, template parts are a “part” of a template.

A template may consist of none, one, or more parts.

The great thing about parts is they help you follow the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle. By including parts in your templates, you avoid having to repeat building the same block code over and over.

On most websites, there are sections of the page that typically stay the same, regardless of the page that you are viewing. *Can you think of any repeated sections that are common on websites?*

The site header and footer are likely the most recognizable “parts” of a webpage, and they just so happen to be the most common template parts you’ll find in themes. While it’s not required to include them, they are *de facto* standards.

Go to **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Patterns &gt; Template Parts** in your WordPress admin. Here is what the Header template part looks like from the default Twenty Twenty-Three theme:

[![WordPress Patterns library showing Header Template parts.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt3-template-parts.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt3-template-parts.jpg?ssl=1)Headers for the Twenty Twenty-Three theme.WordPress looks for template parts in your theme’s `/parts` folder, which should be organized like this:

- `parts/`
    - `header.html`
    - `footer.html`

Other common template parts are for the comments area and sidebars, but your theme can have as few or as many parts as you want.

You’ll learn more about how to register and create custom parts in the [Template Parts](#themes/templatestemplate-parts/) documentation.

# Custom Functionality (functions.php) <a name="themes/core-concepts/custom-functionality" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/core-concepts/custom-functionality/

This document will introduce you to the `functions.php` file. It is one of the optional standard files you first learned about in [Theme Structure](#themes/core-concepts/theme-structure). Both block and classic themes can utilize it.

The following will introduce you to the core concepts around using PHP within `functions.php`, but it will not teach you the PHP programming language itself. You can visit the official [PHP documentation](https://www.php.net/) for more information on how to write your own PHP code.

Throughout the handbook, you will encounter more examples where you will add custom functionality, so getting the basics down is important. You can jump into more advanced PHP examples in the [Features](#themes/features), [Advanced Topics](#themes/advanced-topics), and [Classic Themes](#themes/classic-themes) chapters.

## What is functions.php?

The `functions.php` essentially acts like a WordPress plugin, letting you add custom PHP functions, classes, interfaces, and more. It opens up the entirety of the PHP programming language to your theme.

WordPress automatically loads the `functions.php` file (if it exists) as soon as it loads the theme on all page views on both the admin and front-end of the website. So it provides you with a lot of power to build unique features around WordPress.

Just because you *can* build plugin-like features in a theme doesn’t mean you always should, particularly if you are distributing your theme to others to use. If you are creating features that should be available regardless of the site’s design, **it is best practice to put the code in a plugin**. The rule of thumb is that themes should only deal with the site’s design.

While all themes can have a custom `functions.php` file, WordPress will only load the currently active theme’s.

The only caveat to that rule is when a child theme is active. In that case, WordPress loads the child theme’s `functions.php` just before loading the parent theme’s `functions.php`. You can learn more about [child themes](#themes/advanced-topicschild-themes/) in the Advanced Topics chapter.

## Common uses for functions.php

Because the `functions.php` file lets you write any PHP, you will often see themes with wildly different code, organizational systems, naming conventions, and more. The deeper your understanding of PHP, the easier it will be to follow the code from other themes.

The following are some uses you will often find in a theme’s `functions.php` file.

### Adding actions or filters to hooks

Hooks are the entry point to extending WordPress’ functionality, providing you with a way to inject custom code or filter data. Think of them as a way for themes (and plugins) to communicate directly with WordPress.

WordPress’ hooks system offers two different methods for executing your code during the page loading process:

- [**Action hooks**](#plugins/hooks/actions) allow you to run a custom action callback and “act on” the information that it receives.
- [**Filter hooks**](#plugins/hooks/filters) let you filter data via a custom filter callback and manipulate it.

Technically, hooks are a part of the Plugin API, and you can [read the documentation](#plugins/hooks) on them in the Plugin Handbook.

Despite being in the Plugin API, hooks are also extremely useful in the context of themes. Like plugins, you should always run your code on a hook so that it performs its functionality at the appropriate point in the load process.

Throughout this handbook, you will see examples of adding features or functionality from `functions.php`, and these examples will always use a hook. Familiarizing yourself with their documentation will make it easier to understand PHP code in the handbook.

### Theme setup function

One common use case for many themes is adding a setup function, which is generally used to register theme-supported features with WordPress. This is almost always executed on the `after_setup_theme` action hook, which is the first hook available after a theme’s `functions.php` file has been loaded.

To test this, open your theme’s `functions.php` file (create one if it doesn’t exist), and add the following PHP code:

```php
<?php
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'theme_slug_setup' );

function theme_slug_setup() {
	add_theme_support( 'wp-block-styles' );
}
```

This code adds support for WordPress’ more-opinionated block styles to your theme. You do not have to use this; it is merely serving as an example of what a setup function might look like.

Setup functions are more common in classic themes. When using a block theme, the theme is often automatically opted into the features needed. You can find a list of theme-supported features here:

- [Function Reference: `add_theme_support()`](#reference/functions/add_theme_support)
- [Block Editor Handbook: Theme Support](#block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-support)

### Loading scripts and styles

If you are familiar with HTML, you will likely have come across adding JavaScript via the `<script>` tag or stylesheets via the `<link rel=”stylesheet”/>` or `<style>` tags.

WordPress provides helper functions and specific action hooks for loading scripts and styles. This ensures that they are injected at the appropriate place in the document output. WordPress creates the appropriate HTML markup for you.

You can learn more about loading scripts and styles in the [Including Assets](#themes/core-conepts/including-assets) documentation.

It is not uncommon when building block themes to have no need of including additional scripts/styles. Some themes rely entirely on [Global Settings and Styles](#themes/core-concepts/global-settings-and-styles) for the front-end design.

## Including other PHP files

WordPress will automatically load your theme’s `functions.php` for you, but you are not limited to only adding custom PHP code in that file. You can load other files with PHP interfaces, classes, traits, and functions from elsewhere in your theme.

As you learned in [Theme Structure](#themes/core-concepts/theme-structure), some themes include a custom folder named `/inc` (or any custom folder) to store custom PHP files. Let’s assume you had an `/inc/helpers.php` file for custom helper functions, you could load it via `functions.php` using the `get_parent_theme_file_path()` function:

```php
include get_parent_theme_file_path( 'inc/helpers.php' );
```

Generally speaking, you should use this function to get the correct directory path to any PHP file you need to load.

Alternatively, if you wanted to allow a child theme to override the file with a fallback to the parent theme, you could use `get_theme_file_path()` instead:

```php
include get_theme_file_path( 'inc/helpers.php' );
```

It’s not standard practice to let child theme’s override files with PHP functions or classes, but there are use cases where it’s needed.

## Avoid closing ?&gt; tags at the end of files

This section could otherwise be titled “How to avoid the dreaded WordPress *white screen of death*.”

There are various reasons that you might see a broken site with nothing but a white screen. One of those reasons is when the `functions.php` file (or any PHP file) has whitespace following its closing `?>` tag like this:

```php
<?php
// some code...
?>
 
```

Many editor configurations will automatically add an extra line at the end of files (a common development practice). When you add a closing `?>` tag at the end of the file, it can be easy to miss this extra whitespace, which may cause the “white screen of death” in some environments.

The easiest way to avoid this issue is to leave the closing `?>` tag out altogether, which is perfectly valid PHP and standard practice. The above code should be written as:

```php
<?php
// some code...
 
```

# Including Assets <a name="themes/core-concepts/including-assets" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/core-concepts/including-assets/

Many block themes do not need to load any assets. For design aspects, specifically, much of this can be handled through the [Global Settings and Styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles) system. But there are times when you might need to include a CSS stylesheet, custom JavaScript file, or even other types of media.

If you are familiar with HTML, you might be accustomed to including CSS stylesheets via the `<link rel=”stylesheet”/>` or `<style>` tags. The same might be true for including JavaScript via the `<script>` tag. But you should never manually hard code these HTML elements in your theme.

WordPress has specific hooks for determining when to load scripts/styles and functions for generating the markup. This ensures that WordPress, any active plugins, and your theme all play nicely together.

In this document, you will learn the necessary functions for generating the proper URL to point to asset files and how to include scripts, styles, and other assets in your theme.

This documentation is a leap forward in comparison to some of the previous pages in the Core Concepts chapter. You will need some baseline PHP and HTML knowledge to follow along. You must also understand how to use your [theme’s `functions.php` file](#themes/core-concepts/custom-functionality). This is necessary for loading CSS stylesheet and JavaScript files.

## URL and directory path functions

Before including assets, you should become familiar with some of the utility functions that WordPress provides for getting URLs and directory paths within a theme. You should always use these helper functions when including any type of asset to ensure the URL or path is correct.

Three of the primary URL helper functions are:

- [`get_stylesheet_uri()`](#reference/functions/get_stylesheet_uri): Returns the active theme’s `style.css` file URL.
- [`get_theme_file_uri( $file )`](#reference/functions/get_theme_file_uri): Returns the active theme’s URL, with an optional `$file` parameter. Falls back to the parent theme if a child theme is active and the file doesn’t exist.
- [`get_parent_theme_file_uri( $file )`](#reference/functions/get_parent_theme_file_uri): Returns the parent theme’s URL, with an optional `$file` path.

For directory paths, which are needed less often for assets, there are two primary functions:

- [`get_theme_file_path( $file )`](#reference/functions/get_theme_file_path): Returns the active theme’s directory path, with an optional `$file` parameter. Falls back to the parent theme if a child theme is active and the file doesn’t exist.
- [`get_parent_theme_file_path( $file )`](#reference/functions/get_parent_theme_file_path): Returns the parent theme’s directory path, with an optional `$file` parameter.

## Including CSS

[`wp_enqueue_style()`](#reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style) is the primary function for enqueueing a stylesheet, which tells WordPress that you want to put it in the queue to load. You would use this function within an action hook callback in your `functions.php` file, which you learned about in [Custom Functionality](#themes/core-concepts/custom-functionality). You’ll learn which action hooks to use for specific scenarios in the next sections.

Take a look at the function signature:

```php
wp_enqueue_style( 
	string $handle, 
	string $src           = '', 
	string[] $deps        = array(), 
	string|bool|null $ver = false, 
	string $media         = 'all'
);
```

You can use these parameters:

- **`$handle`** is a unique name/ID for the stylesheet and should be prefixed with your theme slug.
- **`$src`** is the file URL of your stylesheet. While it is technically an optional parameter, it is required to actually load a specific stylesheet.
- **`$deps`** is an optional array of other stylesheet handles that your stylesheet is dependent upon.
- **`$ver`** sets the version number of your stylesheet and is used for cache busting. Defaults to the current WordPress version.
- **`$media`** is for specifying which type of media to load this stylesheet for, such as `all` (default), `screen`, `print`, or `handheld`.

If you were enqueuing a stylesheet located at `/assets/css/example.css` in your theme, your function call might look like this:

```php
wp_enqueue_style( 
	'theme-slug-example',
	get_parent_theme_file_uri( 'assets/css/example.css' ),
	array(),
	wp_get_theme()->get( 'Version' ),
	'all'
);
```

The above code uses [`wp_get_theme()`](#reference/functions/wp_get_theme) to grab the theme’s version number for cache busting, but you can leave it at the default or use something custom altogether.

### Front-end stylesheets

When loading stylesheets on the front end of a website, you will use the [`wp_enqueue_scripts`](#reference/hooks/wp_enqueue_scripts) hook for most scenarios.

Let’s assume that you wanted to load your theme’s `style.css` file using the `get_stylesheet_uri()` function. You would do this by adding the following code to your `functions.php` file:

```php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'theme_slug_enqueue_styles' );

function theme_slug_enqueue_styles() {
	wp_enqueue_style( 
		'theme-slug-style', 
		get_stylesheet_uri()
	);
}
```

Remember that you can also pass other parameters to the `wp_enqueue_style()` function if needed. The above code is the minimum needed to load the stylesheet.

Let’s further suppose that you wanted to load a second stylesheet located at `/assets/css/primary.css` in your theme. For this, you would use the `get_parent_theme_file_uri()` function to get the correct URL.

Here is what your code would look like with both stylesheets enqueued:

```php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'theme_slug_enqueue_styles' );

function theme_slug_enqueue_styles() {
	wp_enqueue_style(
		'theme-slug-style', 
		get_stylesheet_uri()
	);

	wp_enqueue_style( 
		'theme-slug-primary',
		get_parent_theme_file_uri( 'assets/css/primary.css' )
	);
}
```

### Inline styles

There are times when you might need to add some inline CSS to the `<head>` area on the front end. WordPress has the [`wp_add_inline_style()`](#reference/functions/wp_add_inline_style) function for this specific scenario.

Here is a look at the function signature:

```php
wp_add_inline_style( 
	string $handle, 
	string $data 
);
```

In this case, you must pass in a `$handle` parameter that matches a handle of an existing stylesheet that is enqueued for the page. The `$data` parameter is your custom CSS code.

Let’s extend the code from the previous section by adding a small bit of CSS that sets the body background color to a light gray:

```php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'theme_slug_enqueue_styles' );

function theme_slug_enqueue_styles() {
	wp_enqueue_style(
		'theme-slug-style', 
		get_stylesheet_uri()
	);

	wp_enqueue_style( 
		'theme-slug-primary',
		get_parent_theme_file_uri( 'assets/css/primary.css' )
	);

	wp_add_inline_style( 
		'theme-slug-primary', 
		'body { background: #eee; }'
	);
}
```

In the `wp_add_inline_style()` function call, the code uses the existing `theme-slug-primary` handle to attach an inline style.

### Editor stylesheets

When creating a theme with custom CSS on the front end, you will almost always want your custom styles to also appear in the editor. This will create a consistent user experience across the site. But WordPress does not automatically load your front-end stylesheets in the editor.

For that, you will need to use the [`add_editor_style()`](#reference/functions/add_editor_style) function:

```php
add_editor_style( array|string $stylesheet = 'editor-style.css' );
```

It accepts a single parameter of `$stylesheet`, which can be a single stylesheet filename or an array of filenames. These can be relative to the theme folder or a full URL.

Note that when using relative URLs, a file in the child theme with the same filename will take priority. That’s why it’s generally best practice to use the full stylesheet URL.

This code snippet shows how to add the active theme’s main `style.css` file as an editor style:

```php
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'theme_slug_setup' );

function theme_slug_setup() {
	add_editor_style( get_stylesheet_uri() );
}
```

If you wanted to add both the `style.css` file and `primary.css` from the earlier examples, you could pass them in as an array:

```php
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'theme_slug_setup' );

function theme_slug_setup() {
	add_editor_style( array(
		get_stylesheet_uri(),
		get_parent_theme_file_uri( 'assets/css/primary.css' )
	) );
}
```

### Block stylesheets

WordPress also includes a [`wp_enqueue_block_style()`](#reference/functions/wp_enqueue_block_style) function for loading per-block stylesheets in the editor and on the front end. This is covered in full detail in the [Block Stylesheets](#themes/features/block-stylesheets) documentation.

For an advanced exploration of block stylesheets, read [Leveraging theme.json and per-block styles for more performant themes](#news/2022/12/leveraging-theme-json-and-per-block-styles-for-more-performant-themes) on the WordPress Developer Blog.

## Including JavaScript

Like stylesheets, WordPress has a primary function for enqueueing JavaScript files: [`wp_enqueue_script()`](#reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script). You would also use this function within an action hook callback in your `functions.php` file, and you’ll learn which hooks to use in the following sections.

Take a look at the function signature:

```php
wp_enqueue_script( 
	string $handle, 
	string $src           = '', 
	string[] $deps        = array(), 
	string|bool|null $ver = false, 
	array|bool $in_footer = false
);
```

You can use these parameters:

- **`$handle`:** A unique name/ID for the script and should be prefixed with your theme slug.
- **`$src`:** The file URL of your script. While it is technically an optional parameter, it is required to actually load a specific script
- **`$deps`:** An optional array of other script handles that your script is dependent upon.
- **`$ver`:** Sets the version number of your script and is used for cache busting. Defaults to the current WordPress version.
- **`$in_footer`:** Determines whether to load the script in the header or footer. As of WordPress 6.3, this parameter accepts an array of values: 
    - **`strategy`:** Accepts either `'defer'` (default) or `'async'` to set the script-loading strategy.
    - **`in_footer`:** A boolean value to determine whether to load the script in the header or footer.

If you were enqueuing a script located at `/assets/js/example.js` in your theme, your function call might look like this:

```php
wp_enqueue_script( 
	'theme-slug-example',
	get_parent_theme_file_uri( 'assets/js/example.js' ),
	array(),
	wp_get_theme()->get( 'Version' ),
	true
);
```

### Front-end JavaScript

When loading stylesheets on the front end of a website, you will use the [`wp_enqueue_scripts`](#reference/hooks/wp_enqueue_scripts) hook for most scenarios.

Suppose you had a custom navigation script located at `assets/js/navigations.js` in your theme. For this, you would use the `get_parent_theme_file_uri()` function to get the correct URL.

Here is what your function would look like when enqueueing the script:

```php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'theme_slug_enqueue_scripts' );

function theme_slug_enqueue_scripts() {
	wp_enqueue_script( 
		'theme-slug-navigation',
		get_parent_theme_file_uri( 'assets/js/navigation.js' ),
		array(),
		wp_get_theme()->get( 'Version' ),
		true
	);
}
```

### Inline JavaScript

Sometimes you might want to add some inline JavaScript to the `<head>` area on the front end. WordPress has the [`wp_add_inline_script()`](#reference/functions/wp_add_inline_script) function for this purpose.

Take a look at the function signature:

```php
wp_add_inline_script( 
	string $handle, 
	string $data, 
	string $position = 'after' 
);
```

Like its counterpart for styles, you must attach this to an enqueued script via the `$handle` parameter. The secondary parameter, `$data`, should be the JavaScript code itself. The difference here is the addition of a third parameter, `$position`, which lets you position the inline script before or after the script that it is attached to.

The following code builds on top of the navigation script from the previous section by adding an inline script to it:

```php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'theme_slug_enqueue_scripts' );

function theme_slug_enqueue_scripts() {
	wp_enqueue_script( 
		'theme-slug-navigation',
		get_parent_theme_file_uri( 'assets/js/navigation.js' ),
		array(),
		wp_get_theme()->get( 'Version' ),
		true
	);

	wp_add_inline_script( 
		'theme-slug-navigation', 
		'console.log( "Testing" );'
	);
}
```

In the `wp_add_inline_script()` function call, the code uses the existing `theme-slug-navigation` handle to attach the inline style.

### Editor JavaScript

When you need to load a JavaScript file for the block editor, you must use the [`enqueue_block_editor_assets`](#reference/hooks/enqueue_block_editor_assets) hook. Note that this is for loading scripts on the admin page itself and not within the content iframe.

Suppose you had an `assets/js/editor.js` file that you needed to load for the editor. Your code should look like this:

```php
add_action( 'enqueue_block_editor_assets', 'theme_slug_enqueue_editor_scripts' );

function theme_slug_enqueue_editor_scripts() {
	wp_enqueue_script( 
		'theme-slug-editor',
		get_parent_theme_file_uri( 'assets/js/editor.js' ),
		array(),
		wp_get_theme()->get( 'Version' ),
		true
	);
}
```

Generally, themes wouldn’t need to load JavaScript for the editor itself. But for advanced use cases, it may be necessary. It is also recommended to integrate with the [`@wordpress/scripts`](#block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts) package for easier management. For more information on how to do this, read [Beyond block styles, part 1: using the WordPress scripts package with themes](#news/2023/07/beyond-block-styles-part-1-using-the-wordpress-scripts-package-with-themes).

### Default WordPress scripts

WordPress bundles many custom and third-party scripts. You should always use these scripts if you need one of them instead of loading a custom version. This ensures that you avoid conflicts with plugins.

Some of the scripts are referenced in the [`wp_enqueue_script()` documentation](#reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script), but that list may not always be up to date. You can find the full list of included files in [wp-includes/script-loader.php](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/script-loader.php).

## Including images

Block themes will not often need to include images, except in patterns. You will learn more about these in the [Block Patterns](#themes/features/block-patterns) documentation. But for a quick overview, let’s take a look at how to reference an image in your theme.

Assuming you had an image file located at `assets/img/example.webp`, you would use this code to reference the correct URL:

```php
<img src="<?php echo esc_url( get_parent_theme_file_uri( 'assets/img/example.webp' ) ); ?>" alt="" />
```

Note that the above example uses `get_parent_theme_file_uri()`. In most cases, this will be the correct function.

But if you are building a child theme or a theme where you would like to allow other child theme authors to override the image, you can use `get_theme_file_uri()` instead:

```php
<img src="<?php echo esc_url( get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/img/example.webp' ) ); ?>" alt="" />
```

## Including fonts

Typically, you would expect fonts to fall directly under the assets documentation. But WordPress has special methods for loading fonts via the `theme.json` file that integrates with the editor. This documentation is under the [Typography](#themes/global-settings-and-stylessettings/typography/) page of the Global Settings and Styles chapter.

# Global Settings and Styles <a name="themes/core-concepts/global-settings-and-styles" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/core-concepts/global-settings-and-styles/

As you learned in [Theme Structure](#themes/core-concepts/theme-structure), `theme.json` is a standard file that WordPress looks for in your theme. While it is not technically required for a block theme, it is almost always necessary to configure various settings and styles for your theme.

This documentation is a quick introduction on what `theme.json` is and how it works. However, it is such a massive topic that there is a dedicated chapter that explores everything you can do with it: [Global Settings and Styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles).

## What is theme.json?

`theme.json` is a configuration file that tells WordPress what settings you want to enable, how to style specific elements and blocks, and which templates and template parts to register.

Some of the things you can do with `theme.json` are:

- Enable or disable features like drop caps, padding, margin, and line-height.
- Add a color palette, gradients, duotones, and shadows.
- Configure typographical features like font families, sizes, and more.
- Add CSS custom properties.
- Register custom templates and assign parts to template part areas.

Your `theme.json` configuration will be reflected in what you see in places like the post, template, and site editors in the WordPress admin. Custom styles, in particular, will be reflected in the **Styles** interface:

[![WordPress Site Editor viewing a Single Post template. On the right, the Buttons block is highlighted in the Styles interface.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/global-styles-site-editor.jpg?resize=2048%2C1066&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/global-styles-site-editor.jpg?ssl=1)## theme.json structure

A `theme.json` file can be as little as a few lines of code, such as this example that enables the appearance tools for blocks:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json",
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {
		"appearanceTools": true
	}
}
```

Or it can be a massively complex file that spans 1,000s of lines of code. How many of the features you want to configure is entirely up to you.

The starting point is understanding the top-level properties that can be configured. Here is an outline of what this looks like:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json",
	"version": 2,
	"settings": {},
	"styles": {},
	"customTemplates": {},
	"templateParts": {},
	"patterns": []
}
```

Here are what each of these properties define:

- **`$schema`:** Used for defining the supported JSON schema, which will integrate with many code editors to give you on-the-fly hints and error reporting.
- **`version`:** The `theme.json` schema version you are building for. The latest version is 2 and can always be found in the [`theme.json` Living Reference](#block-editor/reference-guides/theme-json-reference/theme-json-living), a document that lists the most up-to-date properties you can set.
- **`settings`:** Used to define your block controls and color palettes, font sizes, and more.
- **`styles`:** Used to apply colors, font sizes, custom CSS, and more to the website and blocks.
- **`customTemplates`:** Metadata for custom templates defined in your theme’s `/templates` folder.
- **`templateParts`:** Metadata for template parts defined in your theme’s `/parts` folder.
- **`patterns`:** An array of pattern slugs to be registered from the [Pattern Directory](https://wordpress.org/patterns/).

You will learn more about these properties and their sub-properties in the [Global Settings and Styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles) chapter.

## Settings and styles hierarchy

The `theme.json` file in your theme is only one level in a hierarchy of setting and style configurations for a website. This means it can be overridden under certain circumstances.

The order of this hierarchy from lowest to highest is:

- **WordPress `theme.json`:** WordPress has its own `theme.json` file that defines the default settings and styles.
- **Theme `theme.json`:** Anything you define in your theme’s `theme.json` file overrides the WordPress defaults.
- **Child theme `theme.json`:** If active, a child theme’s `theme.json` takes priority over the main or “parent” theme.
- **User configuration:** Users can further customize how their site works under **Appearance &gt; Editor** in the WordPress admin, and the JSON data is saved in their site’s database. Their choice takes priority over all other levels in the hierarchy.

There are also filter hooks available that let plugin and theme authors override the values dynamically. To learn more about these, check out [How to modify theme.json data using server-side filters](#news/2023/07/how-to-modify-theme-json-data-using-server-side-filters) from the WordPress Developer Blog.

The important thing to remember is that anything configured in your `theme.json` file may not take priority in the hierarchy.

# Internationalization <a name="themes/advanced-topics/internationalization" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/internationalization/

Internationalization is the process of developing your theme in such a way that its custom text can be translated into other languages. The term is often abbreviated as “i18n” because there are 18 letters between the “i” and “n,” the first and last letters.

In this article, you will learn how to internationalize your WordPress themes and why it is important.

## Why internationalization is important

WordPress is used all over the world, in countries where your native language is not used. The strings in the WordPress themes need to be coded in a special way so that they can be easily translated into other languages.

Even if you yourself do not know multiple languages, internationalization leaves the door open for translators to localize the text. Localization is the process of taking internationalized text and translating it for a specific language and locale. It is often abbreviated as “l10n.”

WordPress has a built-in translation system that allows localizing a theme without having to modify the source code of the theme itself. This is important because it means that users can keep up with theme updates while using their preferred translation.

You can certainly build a WordPress theme without internationalization, particularly if it’s for a site that you know will never be translated. But in most cases, it is considered standard practice to internationalize all of your theme’s text. For one, it means that it can be used by people in other languages, giving you a wider audience. And it [is also a requirement](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/#8-language-internationalization) when submitting a theme to the official [Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/).

## How to internationalize your theme

### Getting your text domain

The text domain is a unique identifier, allowing WordPress to distinguish between all of the loaded translations. That means that you need something unique for your theme so that WordPress will recognize translations that belong to it.

The text domain is used in three different places in your theme:

- In the `style.css` file header.
- As an argument in internationalization functions.
- As an argument when loading translations (optional for themes submitted to the WordPress [Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/)).

Your theme’s text domain should always match your theme slug, as described in the [Reading this handbook](#themes/getting-started/reading-this-handbook) documentation. This is a central component in making sure your theme is ready for translation.

The *de facto* standard (and requirement if submitting your theme to the WordPress Theme Directory) is to use the [kebab-case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Kebab_case) version of your theme name. This means that it should:

- Use all lowercase letters.
- Have no spaces.
- Hyphenate when there are multiple words.

So if your theme’s name is `Fabled Sunset`, your text domain should be `fabled-sunset`.

### Defining your text domain

As described in the [Main Stylesheet](#themes/core-concepts/main-stylesheet) documentation, you can configure several important pieces of metadata about your theme via the `style.css` file header. In particular, there are two meta values you can define related to internationalization:

- **Text Domain:** The string used for the text domain for translations.
- **Domain Path:** A relative path to where theme translations are stored. WordPress uses this field when the theme is disabled to detect translations. Defaults to `/languages` if not defined.

For translations to work correctly, you must at least define the `Text Domain` field, which should be your theme’s slug.

Let’s imagine your theme name is “Fabled Sunset” and you want translations stored in your theme’s `/assets/lang` folder. Your theme’s `style.css` should define these fields like so:

```css
/**
 * Theme Name:        Fabled Sunset
 * ...
 * Text Domain:       fabled-sunset
 * Domain Path:       /assets/lang
 * ...
 */
```

It’s important to add this metadata to your `style.css` file because WordPress uses it even when the theme is not enabled (for example, when viewing all themes from the **Appearance &gt; Themes** screen in the admin).

### Wrapping text with internationalization functions

For text in your theme to be easily translated in your theme, it must be wrapped in an internationalization function instead of hardcoded. The available [internationalization functions](#apis/internationalization/internationalization-functions) are listed in the Common APIs handbook.

In a typical HTML-based webpage, you would add plain text strings. For example, take a look at this example heading:

```markup
<h2>Latest Posts</h2>
```

Because it is merely plain text, it cannot be translated into other languages without directly modifying the code.

Let’s wrap that text in the [`_e()`](#reference/functions/_e) internationalization function, which tells WordPress that the text inside should be available for translation and echoed (printed to the screen):

```php
<h2><?php _e( 'Latest Posts', 'themeslug' ); ?></h2>
```

Now users can add translations for your theme without touching the code.

As you may have noticed, the `_e()` function accepted a second parameter of `themeslug`. This should be replaced with your text domain.

There are many other internationalization functions that you will use, and you will learn about them later. For now, the idea is to introduce you to the basic concept.

Because internationalized text is technically a PHP variable, it means that it can be exploited and become a security vulnerability. You should always use the [translate-and-escape functions](#apis/internationalization/internationalization-functions#translate-escape-functions) when possible. Otherwise, be sure to wrap them in an escaping function when outputting, as described in the [Security](#themes/advanced-topics/security) documentation.

### Loading translations

For themes hosted in the WordPress [Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/), you do not need to load translations. WordPress automatically checks the `wp-content/languages` directory in a user’s install and will download translations from the [Translating WordPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/) site. All translations can be handled there, and you don’t have to worry about storing or loading them from your theme.

Translation in WordPress are saved in `.po` (human readable) and `.mo` (machine readable) files. The `.mo` files are the ones actually used by WordPress.

WordPress will look in two places for translation files based on the user’s locale defined for the site:

- `wp-content/themes/your-theme/{domain-path}/{locale}.mo`
- `wp-content/languages/themes/{textdomain}-{locale}.mo`

To load translation files from your theme, you must use one of two functions:

- [`load_theme_textdomain()`](#reference/functions/load_theme_textdomain)
- [`load_child_theme_textdomain()`](#reference/functions/load_child_theme_textdomain) (if building a [child theme](#themes/advanced-topics/child-themes))

Let’s take a look at the `load_theme_textdomain()` function signature (it’s the same for both functions):

```php
load_theme_textdomain(
	string $domain, 
	string|false $path = false 
): bool
```

The function accepts two parameters:

- **`$domain`:** This should be the text domain for your theme as defined in `style.css`.
- **`$path`:** This must be a full directory path to the location of translations in your theme. If left undefined, WordPress will fall back to your theme’s root folder.

Using the same example “Fabled Sunset” theme described earlier with translations stored in the `/assets/lang` folder, let’s try loading translations from the theme.

Add this code to your theme’s `functions.php` file:

```php
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'themeslug_load_textdomain' );

function themeslug_load_textdomain() {
	load_theme_textdomain(
		'fabled-sunset',
		get_parent_theme_file_path( 'assets/lang' )
	);
}
```

The above call to `load_theme_textdomain()` was executed on the [`after_setup_theme`](#reference/hooks/after_setup_theme) action hook, which fires immediately after the theme’s `functions.php` is loaded.

If you were building a child theme, your `functions.php` code would instead look like this:

```php
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'themeslug_load_textdomain' );

function themeslug_load_textdomain() {
	load_child_theme_textdomain(
		'fabled-sunset',
		get_theme_file_path( 'assets/lang' )
	);
}
```

## Resources

Internationalization is a large topic and is covered in full in the [Internationalization chapter](#apis/internationalization) of the Common APIs handbook. What you learn there will apply to both theme and plugin development.

WordPress has many [internationalization functions](#apis/internationalization/internationalization-functions) for you to use when wrapping text. Which one to use will be context-specific. Take the time to study each function so that you will know when to use it. The [Internationalization Guidelines](#apis/internationalizationinternationalization-guidelines/) will set you down the correct path.

# Build Process <a name="themes/advanced-topics/build-process" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/build-process/

A build process is a method of converting source code files into a final build/production version that can be read by the computer. In particular, themes will most often be minifying or converting source code into CSS or JavaScript so that they can be read by the browser.

When creating a WordPress theme, you may find yourself in need of a build process to handle more complex projects. There are many systems to choose from, and you can use whatever you prefer. But WordPress also offers a standard package that you can be assured is continually updated and should cover most of your needs.

In this article, you will learn how to integrate with the [`@wordpress/scripts`](#block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts) package to handle your theme’s build process.

## Prerequisites

Most of WordPress theme development is pretty much plug and play. You just need a code editor and an install of WordPress in some type of development environment as outlined in [Tools and Setup](#themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup). But to work with a build process, there are some other requirements:

- You need to have [Node.js and npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) on your local machine.
- A basic [understanding of webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/) is also highly recommended.
- Some familiarity with the [`@wordpress/scripts`](#block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts) package (read [Getting started with wp-scripts](#block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-scripts) in the Block Editor Handbook).

These are more advanced tools than what is normally required to build themes, but they are necessary if you want to work with the standard WordPress build process.

## Setting up your files and folders

The `@wordpress/scripts` package was originally created for block development, but it evolved to also work with themes over time. By default, it expects that development files live in the `/src` folder and will output build files in the `/build` folder. Because most theme authors utilize a custom system for working with assets, this guide will show you how to do that.

For the examples that follow, you will use this structure within your theme folder:

- `public/`
- `resources/`
    - `js/`
        - `editor.js`
    - `scss/`
        - `editor.scss`
        - `screen.scss`
- `package.json`
- `webpack.config.js`

## Installing the WordPress scripts package

Once you have your files and folders set up, you need to install the correct packages on your local machine.

First, open your theme’s `package.json` file and add the following code:

```json
{
	"name": "your-project-name",
	"scripts": {
		"start": "wp-scripts start --webpack-src-dir=resources --output-path=public",
		"build": "wp-scripts build --webpack-src-dir=resources --output-path=public"
	}
}
```

The `@wordpress/scripts` package has several other [available scripts](#block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts#available-scripts) that you can add, but you will definitely need `start` and `build`.

Now open your command line tool on your computer, navigate to your theme folder, and input the following command:

```bash
npm install @wordpress/scripts path webpack-remove-empty-scripts --save-dev
```

That command installs three packages:

- `@wordpress/scripts`
- `path`
- `webpack-remove-empty-scripts`

The latter two are third-party packages, but they are useful for integrating with webpack in the next step.

## Configuring webpack

The `@wordpress/scripts` package is built on top of webpack. If you were building a block, everything would already be in place for you. However, because you are building a theme, you need to overwrite some of the default configuration of the `@wordpress/scripts` package with your own.

That’s where your theme’s custom `webpack.config.js` file comes in. There two primary things you need to configure:

- The entry points for your custom CSS and JavaScript files (those in the code below correspond to the file structure in this article).
- The `webpack-remove-empty-scripts` plugin so that there are no leftover `.js` files mapped to your CSS.

Add the following code to your `webpack.config.js` file:

```javascript
// WordPress webpack config.
const defaultConfig = require( '@wordpress/scripts/config/webpack.config' );

// Plugins.
const RemoveEmptyScriptsPlugin = require( 'webpack-remove-empty-scripts' );

// Utilities.
const path = require( 'path' );

// Add any new entry points by extending the webpack config.
module.exports = {
	...defaultConfig,
	...{
		entry: {
			'js/editor':  path.resolve( process.cwd(), 'resources/js',   'editor.js'   ),
			'css/screen': path.resolve( process.cwd(), 'resources/scss', 'screen.scss' ),
			'css/editor': path.resolve( process.cwd(), 'resources/scss', 'editor.scss' ),
		},
		plugins: [
			// Include WP's plugin config.
			...defaultConfig.plugins,

			// Removes the empty `.js` files generated by webpack but
			// sets it after WP has generated its `*.asset.php` file.
			new RemoveEmptyScriptsPlugin( {
				stage: RemoveEmptyScriptsPlugin.STAGE_AFTER_PROCESS_PLUGINS
			} )
		]
	}
};
```

## Using the WordPress scripts package

To use the WordPress scripts package to process your assets, you can run one of two commands in your command line tool:

- `start`: Builds the development version of your files and activates “watch” mode, which will process any code changes while enabled.
- `build`: Builds the production version of your files.

Now open your command line tool and run the `start` command:

```bash
npm run start
```

It should automatically process your files from the `/resources` folder and place them in the `/public` folder with this structure:

- `public/`
    - `js/`
        - `editor.js`
        - `editor.asset.php`
    - `scss/`
        - `editor.scss`
        - `editor.asset.php`
        - `screen.scss`
        - `screen.asset.php`

You’ll now see new `*.asset.php` files generated for each of your CSS and JavaScript files. These will contain metadata about each asset file that you can use when loading your files. This is covered in the “Loading scripts and styles” section below.

To disable the `start` command, type `Ctrl + C` (on either Windows or Mac) of your command line tool.

Once you’re ready to do a final production build of your files, run this command in your command line tool:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Loading scripts and styles

The methods for loading scripts and styles are already covered in depth in the [Including Assets](#themes/core-concepts/including-assets) documentation in this handbook. You should already be familiar with how to do this before proceeding with the next steps.

The documentation below is primarily geared towards teaching you how the `*.asset.php` file is generated for each asset. In each file, you will see an array that looks similar to the following snippet:

```php
<?php return array('dependencies' => array('wp-block-editor'), 'version' => '2eae4c519afeff2a8c77');
```

In particular, the array will have two pieces of metadata that you can use in any `wp_enqueue_*()` functions:

- **`dependencies`:** An array of dependencies that your script/style rely on.
- **`version`:** A version number that you can use for cache busting.

Because the file returns the array, you can use PHP’s `include` to assign the array to a variable in your code. The following example shows getting the array for the `screen.asset.php` file:

```php
$asset = include get_theme_file_path( 'public/css/screen.asset.php' );
// Returns: array( 'dependencies' => array(), 'version' => '0000' );
```

When loading a script or style using either [`wp_enqueue_script()`](#reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script) or [`wp_enqueue_style()`](#reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style), you can pass `$asset['dependencies']` and `$asset['version']` to the corresponding parameters in the functions.

Try adding the following code to your theme’s `functions.php` file to load the assets that you’ve previously defined:

```php
// Load front-end assets.
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'themeslug_assets' );

function themeslug_assets() {
	$asset = include get_theme_file_path( 'public/css/screen.asset.php' );

	wp_enqueue_style(
		'themeslug-style',
		get_theme_file_uri( 'public/css/screen.css' ),
		$asset['dependencies'],
		$asset['version']
	);
}

// Load editor stylesheets.
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'themeslug_editor_styles' );

function themeslug_editor_styles() {
	add_editor_style( [
		get_theme_file_uri( 'public/css/screen.css' )
	] );
}

// Load editor scripts.
add_action( 'enqueue_block_editor_assets', 'themeslug_editor_assets' );

function themeslug_editor_assets() {
	$script_asset = include get_theme_file_path( 'public/js/editor.asset.php'  );
	$style_asset  = include get_theme_file_path( 'public/css/editor.asset.php' );

	wp_enqueue_script(
		'themeslug-editor',
		get_theme_file_uri( 'public/js/editor.js' ),
		$script_asset['dependencies'],
		$script_asset['version'],
		true
	);

	wp_enqueue_style(
		'themeslug-editor',
		get_theme_file_uri( 'public/css/editor.css' ),
		$style_asset['dependencies'],
		$style_asset['version']
	);
}
```

# Privacy <a name="themes/advanced-topics/privacy" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/privacy/

WordPress 4.9.6 introduced several tools to help sites meet the requirements of the European Union’s new GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and other potential laws across the world. This article details what theme authors need to know about compatibility with the features.

For the most part, this should not directly impact themes, but you should make sure that nothing in your theme’s design or functionality conflicts with these features.

## Privacy Policy page

WordPress lets users select a privacy policy page via the **Settings &gt; Privacy** screen in the admin. For newly-created WordPress installs (since version 4.9.6), a privacy policy page is automatically created with a draft status.

### Linking to the Privacy Policy page

If you need to manually link to the Privacy Policy page on a site, WordPress provides a few functions for getting or outputting the URL or link:

- [**`get_privacy_policy_url()`**](#reference/functions/get_privacy_policy_url)**:** Retrieves the URL to the Privacy Policy page.
- [**`the_privacy_policy_link()`**](#reference/functions/the_privacy_policy_link)**:** Displays the Privacy Policy page link with formatting, when applicable.
- [**`get_the_privacy_policy_link()`**](#reference/functions/get_the_privacy_policy_link)**:** Returns the Privacy Policy page link with formatting, when applicable.

The following example will display the privacy policy link surrounded by a `<div>` element:

```php
<?php the_privacy_policy_link( '<div>', '</div>' ); ?>
```

### Privacy Policy page template

While it is generally unnecessary for most themes, you can add a custom [Privacy Policy template](#themes/templates/template-hierarchy) to customize the output of the page. This is an optional template:

- **Block Themes:** `templates/privacy-policy.html`
- **Classic Themes:** `privacy-policy.php`

If you decide to create a custom template, make sure that you output the page’s content using the appropriate block or function:

- **Block Themes:** [Post Content block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-content-block/)
- **Classic Themes:** [`the_content()` function](#reference/functions/the_content)

This ensures that the user’s Privacy Policy content will be correctly displayed on the front end of the site.

## Comment cookies

When a logged out user comments on a post, they are asked for their name, email, and website. This information is stored locally in the commenter’s browser for two purposes:

1. When they leave another comment on the site, their name, email, and website will be pre-populated into the respective fields.
2. If their comment is held for moderation, they can return to that post and remove the comment before it is approved.

The information stored in this cookie is for convenience and is not essential. Therefore, the user needs to be given the choice to opt in or opt out of the storage of this data. For this reason, WordPress outputs a checkbox in the comment form that allows commenters to opt-in to storing this data in the cookie. This checkbox will be unchecked by default, as opt-in is an action the user must explicitly approve.

The new checkbox field is automatically added to comment forms displayed using the [Comment Form](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-comments-form-block/) block (block themes) or the [`comment_form()`](#reference/functions/comment_form) function (classic themes).

While most themes will not require any action, it is recommended that you double check that the input and label does not require CSS adjustments in custom themes.

# Debugging <a name="themes/advanced-topics/debugging" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/debugging/

Debugging is the practice of finding and fixing errors in any software that you build. And it is an essential part of WordPress theme development, regardless of whether you are building a block or classic theme.

WordPress provides some tools out of the box, but there are also plugins that you can use to enhance the experience. You’ll learn about some of these methods in this article, but you should also study the [Debugging in WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/debugging-in-wordpress/) documentation in the Common APIs handbook.

## Debugging constants

When creating themes from within a development environment, you should always enable debugging to ensure that your theme is not creating notices or errors. WordPress offers several constants, which you can set in your installation’s `wp-config.php` file.

If you open the `wp-config.php` file, scroll down until you locate this code:

```php
/**
 * For developers: WordPress debugging mode.
 *
 * Change this to true to enable the display of notices during development.
 * It is strongly recommended that plugin and theme developers use WP_DEBUG
 * in their development environments.
 *
 * For information on other constants that can be used for debugging,
 * visit the documentation.
 *
 * @link https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/debugging-in-wordpress/
 */
define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );
```

This is where you will configure any debugging constants outlined in the sections below.

### WP\_DEBUG

The `WP_DEBUG` constant is the only one defined in a default WordPress installation’s `wp-config.php` file. In a standard install, it is set to `false`, but it is set to `true` if you are running a development copy of WordPress.

The `WP_DEBUG` PHP constant is used to trigger the built-in “debug” mode on your WordPress installation. This allows you to view errors in your theme. It should be used in conjunction with all of the other debugging constants listed in the next sections.

You should see this line in your `wp-config.php` file:

```php
define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );
```

To enable debugging, make sure it is set to `true`, as shown here:

```php
define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
```

### WP\_DISABLE\_FATAL\_ERROR\_HANDLER

WordPress 5.2 [introduced a fatal error handler](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/) to ensure that users do not get locked out of their site when a theme or plugin causes a fatal error. This is a great feature in production/live sites. But it can be problematic in development, preventing you from fully diagnosing errors.

For this reason, in development, you should disable this to make sure things are broken until you can fix them. Define this constant in your `wp-config.php` file:

```php
define( 'WP_DISABLE_FATAL_ERROR_HANDLER', true );
```

### WP\_DEBUG\_DISPLAY

`WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY` is used to control whether debug messages display within the HTML of your WordPress site. By default, when `WP_DEBUG` is enabled, debugging messages will be shown on the screen. So, you can safely not define `WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY` during development.

If you want to disable on-screen debugging messages, you can set `WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY` to `false` in your `wp-config.php` file:

```php
define( 'WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false );
```

### WP\_DEBUG\_LOG

The `WP_DEBUG_LOG` constant is an optional feature that you can set to log errors to a `debug.log` file in your site’s `/wp-content` directory. By default, this is disabled.

Generally, if you turn off on-screen debugging messages via `WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY`, then you will want to opt for storing these messages in the debug log.

To enable logging, define the `WP_DEBUG_LOG` constant as `true` in your `wp-config.php` file:

```php
define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
```

## Plugins

There are several plugins that are helpful when debugging your theme. Each is hosted in the WordPress Plugin Directory:

- [**Debug Bar**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/)**:** Provides a central location for debugging in your WordPress toolbar.
- [**Query Monitor**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/)**:** Enables debugging of database queries, PHP errors, hooks and actions, block editor blocks, enqueued scripts and stylesheets, HTTP API calls, and more.
- [**Log Deprecated Notices**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/log-deprecated-notices/)**:** Logs incorrect and deprecated function and file usages in your theme.

# Security <a name="themes/advanced-topics/security" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/security/

When releasing any code out into the world, whether it will only exist on your own site or hundreds of thousands of sites, it’s important to strive to make it as secure as possible. Responsible coding means being vigilant about all the ways your theme can be exploited.

Your primary source for learning about security in the [Security chapter](#apis/security) in the Common APIs Handbook. This article should be considered a supplement to what you will learn there and is not an all-encompassing guide on security itself.

Below, you will find a list of common vulnerabilities to consider, but please use the Resources section for a more comprehensive overview of how to secure your themes.

## Common vulnerabilities

Security is an ever-changing landscape, and vulnerabilities evolve over time. The following is an overview of common vulnerabilities you should protect against and the techniques for protecting your theme from exploitation.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) happens when a nefarious party injects JavaScript into a web page.

To avoid XSS vulnerabilities, any output should be escaped. Since it’s the theme’s primary responsibility to output content, you should always [escape dynamic content](#apis/securitysanitizing/) with the proper function based on the data type.

This example shows how to escape an image URL to avoid XSS vulnerabilities:

```php
<img src="<?php echo esc_url( $great_user_picture_url ); ?>" />
```

Content that has HTML entities within can be sanitized to allow only specified HTML elements:

```php
$allowed_html = array(
	'a' => array(
		'href' => array()
	),
	'br'     => array(),
	'em'     => array(),
	'strong' => array()
);

echo wp_kses( $custom_content, $allowed_html );
```

### SQL Injection

SQL Injection happens when values being input are not properly sanitized, allowing for any SQL commands in the data to potentially be executed. To prevent this, the WordPress API is extensive. For example, it offers functions like [`add_post_meta()`](#reference/functions/add_post_meta) so that you don’t need to manually insert metadata via SQL.

The first rule for hardening your theme against SQL Injection is: **when there’s a WordPress function, use it.**

While it is rare to do so in themes, sometimes you need to do complex queries that have not been accounted for in the API. If this is the case, always use the [`$wpdb` functions](#reference/classes/wpdb). These were built specifically to protect your database.

All data in SQL queries must be SQL-escaped before the SQL query is executed to prevent SQL injection attacks. The best function to use for SQL-escaping is `$wpdb->prepare()` which supports both a [`sprintf()`](http://secure.php.net/sprintf)-like and [`vsprintf()`](http://secure.php.net/vsprintf)-like syntax:

```php
$wpdb->get_var( $wpdb->prepare(
	"SELECT something FROM table WHERE foo = %s and status = %d",
	$name, // an unescaped string (function will do the sanitization for you)
	$status // an untrusted integer (function will do the sanitization for you)
) );
```

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Cross-site request forgery or CSRF (pronounced *sea-surf*) is when a nefarious party tricks a user into performing an unwanted action within a web application they are authenticated in. For example, a phishing email might contain a link to a page that would delete a user’s account in the WordPress admin.

This is more common in plugins than themes. But if your theme includes any HTML or HTTP-based form submissions, use a [nonce](#apis/securitynonces/) to guarantee a user intends to perform an action:

```php
<form method="post">
	<!-- some inputs here ... -->
	<?php wp_nonce_field( 'name_of_my_action', 'name_of_nonce_field' ); ?>
</form>
```

# Testing <a name="themes/advanced-topics/testing" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/testing/

Whether you are planning to share your WordPress theme with a broad audience or aiming for a specific platform, this article will help you get your theme ready for release. It focuses on general theme testing to ensure your theme’s quality and compatibility across various environments.

Expanding on the principles from previous sections, this article covers things like code quality, compatibility, and responsiveness. By the end, your theme will be ready to use on a live site.

## Testing environment

When building your theme, it is good practice to test from within some type of development environment. In this section, you will get an overview of a couple of methods that you can explore further on your own.

### Local environment

A local development environment provides a controlled space for developing and testing your theme without impacting your live site. Some of the available options are listed in the [Tools and Setup](#themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup) documentation.

When developing locally, you should always have debugging enabled. Check out the [Debugging](#advanced-administration/debug/debug-wordpress) documentation for information on debugging techniques and tools that will help you handle errors and optimize your theme development process.

### WordPress Playground

[WordPress Playground](https://wordpress.org/playground/) is another option for testing. It operates entirely in the browser, providing a controlled space for testing.

Here is a look at the default Twenty Twenty-Four theme running in Playground:

[![Screenshot of a default setup on the WordPress Playground, showing the homepage of the Twenty Twenty-Four theme. There is a top bar for managing the setup.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/02/wordpress-playground.webp?resize=2048%2C1055&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/02/wordpress-playground.webp?ssl=1)To become more familiar with using this platform, please refer to the official [WordPress Playground documentation](https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/).

## Theme Unit Test Data

When developing a WordPress theme, ensuring that it can handle a variety of content is fundamental. To assist in this process, WordPress provides a set of [Theme Unit Test Data](https://github.com/WordPress/theme-test-data/blob/master/themeunittestdata.wordpress.xml) via an importable XML file. To be clear, this is just one part of a larger theme testing process.

The test data is a collection of posts, pages, comments, and media that you can import into your WordPress installation. By testing with this data, you can check how your theme handles edge cases, such as extremely long titles, images of varying sizes, nested comments, and a mix of HTML elements.

To test your theme with the Theme Unit Test Data, you need to:

- **Download the data:** Get the latest version from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WordPress/theme-test-data/blob/master/themeunittestdata.wordpress.xml).
- **Import the data:** Use the [WordPress Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/) tool to import the data into your WordPress environment.

Once you’ve imported the content into your test install, examine how each piece of content is displayed. Pay special attention to areas where your theme might be prone to issues. Also be sure to view your theme on various devices and screen sizes to make sure the content is displayed as expected.

## Tools and resources

When testing your theme, it is important to use tools that will check every aspect of your theme for potential issues.

The [Theme Check Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/) evaluates your theme against the [Theme Review Guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/) before submitting to the official directory. Even if not submitting to the directory, it can also be useful for making sure your theme meets some baseline standards.

Some other WordPress plugins you should include in your testing suite are:

- [Debug Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/): Adds an admin bar to your WordPress admin and provides a central location for debugging.
- [Query Monitor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/): Allows debugging of database queries, API requests, and AJAX used to generate theme pages and functionality.
- [Log Deprecated Notices](https://wordpress.org/plugins/log-deprecated-notices/): Logs incorrect function usage, deprecated file usage, and deprecated function usage in your theme.
- [Monster Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/monster-widget/): Consolidates the core WordPress widgets into a single widget, making it easier to test them all at once (*classic themes only*).

For effective cross-browser compatibility testing of block themes, it is important to use the developer tools available with modern browsers, such as:

- [Firefox: Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/)
- [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools)

## Functional testing

Testing your theme’s compatibility with basic WordPress features is necessary. This step ensures that your theme not only looks good but also works with WordPress’s core functionality.

### Testing basic WordPress features

It is important that your theme works with core features and behaves as expected. The following are some of the basic features to test:

- **Posts and pages:**
    - Create a variety of posts and pages using the block editor. Experiment with different types of content, including text, images, and videos.
    - Pay attention to how all standard blocks (paragraphs, images, headings, lists, etc.) are displayed. Are they aligning correctly? Is the spacing consistent?
- **Block settings:**
    - Test the settings of each block to ensure they function as intended. For instance, when you change the alignment of an image or the color of a heading, does the theme reflect these changes accurately?
- **Responsiveness:**
    - Check how these elements adapt to different screen sizes. Ensure the layout remains intuitive and user-friendly on mobile devices.
- **Comments:**
    - Look at the comments section of your posts. Are comments and replies displaying correctly?
    - Ensure that threaded comments are displayed in a nested format, making it easy to follow conversations.
    - Test the comment block in the block editor. Does it integrate well with your theme? Are there styling or functionality issues?

If you’re building a block theme, as this handbook recommends, you should also test these features:

- **Site Editor:** Test the Site Editor and make sure that you can edit templates and template parts like headers and footers.
- **Styles interface:** Check the functionality of the Styles interface, where you can customize colors, typography, and layout settings that apply across your theme.
- **Navigation block:** Pay special attention to the Navigation block. Test its responsiveness, the ease of adding menu items, sub-menu functionality, and alignment options.
- **Template editing:** Explore the Template Editor for creating and modifying templates for specific posts or pages.

## Accessibility testing

Ensuring accessibility is a key aspect of responsible theme development.

You should strive to make sure your theme meets the [WordPress Accessibility Guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/). This includes aspects like keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and proper use of ARIA roles.

Tools like [aXe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) and [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) are invaluable in identifying potential accessibility issues. Regularly use them during development to find and fix any problems. This proactive approach helps in creating a theme that is accessible to all users, regardless of how they navigate the web.

## Performance testing

You should also ensure that your theme is not unnecessarily loading too many resources. For this, you can use tools like [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to check your theme’s performance. These types of tools provide information on how quickly your theme loads and offers suggestions for improvement.

When shipping media or other assets with your theme, be sure that they are optimized. This includes but is not limited to:

- **Images/Media:** Ensure media items bundled with your theme are correctly sized, in the most appropriate format, and compressed to reduce load times.
- **CSS and JavaScript files:** Make sure to include minified assets that will be loaded by the browser.

# Publishing Themes <a name="themes/advanced-topics/publishing-themes" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/publishing-themes/

Once you have made it through the earlier documentation in this handbook and finally built your first theme, you may also want to share it with others.

In this article, you will learn how to package your theme for release and publish it for other WordPress users to install on their own websites. This documentation will focus on submitting themes to the official [WordPress Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/), but it will also cover some other options.

## Packaging your theme for release

As you approach the exciting milestone of releasing your theme into the WordPress Theme Directory, this article will guide you through the necessary steps and requirements. The instructions provided here build upon the foundational knowledge shared in this handbook, ensuring your theme is ready for its debut in the directory.

### Step 1: Check for required theme files

The journey to releasing your block theme begins with a simple yet necessary step—verifying that you have all the [essential theme files](#themes/core-concepts/theme-structure). For a block theme, this includes, but is not limited to, the [`theme.json`](#themes/core-concepts/global-settings-and-styles), [`style.css`](#themes/core-concepts/main-stylesheet), and various [template files](#themes/core-concepts/templates). Ensuring these files are in place and correctly configured is fundamental to making it through the review process.

### Step 2: Test your theme

Before submitting your theme, make sure to thoroughly [test your theme](#themes/advanced-topics/testing). This includes not only the functionality and responsiveness of the theme but also its content presentation and block editor integration. Use diverse content types to assess how well your theme adapts and displays them, and ensure that there are no [debugging issues](#themes/advanced-topics/debugging).

### Step 3: Follow the Theme Review Guidelines

Familiarize yourself with the latest [Theme Review Guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/). This includes adhering to [WordPress Coding Standards](#coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards), ensuring accessibility, and verifying that the theme supports essential WordPress features. Regular updates to these guidelines mean that staying informed is key to a smooth approval process.

### Step 4: Prepare documentation

Proper documentation is a significant asset to your theme. It should detail the theme’s features, customization options, and any unique aspects of its block editor integration. Clear documentation aids both the review process and the end-users in understanding and making the most of your theme.

### Step 5: Submission and review process

With the above steps completed, you are ready to [submit your theme for review](https://wordpress.org/themes/upload/). Before submission, make sure you read through the [Review Process](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/) guide.

Upon submission, be prepared for interactions with the [Themes Team](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/about/). They may request additional changes or clarifications to ensure your theme meets all the WordPress Theme Directory standards. Responding promptly and effectively to these requests will facilitate a smoother approval process.

Packaging your block theme for release is a meticulous process that requires attention to detail and adherence to WordPress standards. By following these steps, you not only prepare your theme for a successful submission but also set the stage for a positive experience for its future users.

## Why host your theme on WordPress.org?

[![Screenshot of the WordPress.org Theme Directory, showing a three-column grid of theme screenshots.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/01/theme-directory-block-themes.webp?resize=2048%2C1270&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/01/theme-directory-block-themes.webp?ssl=1)Sharing your theme on the WordPress Theme Directory is more than just distribution; it is an opportunity to grow as a developer, receive valuable feedback, and contribute to the vibrant WordPress community.

If you’re still unsure about distributing your theme through the official Theme Directory, here are some other reasons to do so:

**Visibility and reach:**

- **Global Audience:** The WordPress Theme Directory is accessed by millions of users worldwide, providing a lot of potential exposure for your theme.
- **Search Engine Optimization:** Being listed in the directory enhances your theme’s findability via search engines, thanks to WordPress.org’s strong SEO.

**Trust and credibility:**

- **Quality assurance:** Themes in the WordPress directory are known for their quality, having passed a thorough review process.
- **User trust:** Users tend to trust themes from the official directory, as they adhere to WordPress standards. This gives them more credibility than those hosted elsewhere.

**Support and community engagement:**

- **User reviews:** WordPress provides a ratings system that is enabled for all themes, allowing your users to give you feedback.
- **Support forums:** All themes are integrated into the [WordPress.org support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/forums/), giving you a free platform to reply to support queries.

**Simplified update process:**

- **Easy updates:** Distributing through the directory simplifies the process of pushing updates to your users. They will be able to update your theme directly from their site’s admin.
- **Automatic notifications:** Users are automatically notified about updates, increasing the likelihood of them using the latest, most secure version of your theme.

## Other theme hosting options

The official WordPress Theme Directory is not the only option for hosting your theme if you plan to distribute it to the public, whether for free or at cost. Below, you’ll learn about a few of the advantages and disadvantages of some alternatives.

### Hosting your theme on a custom website

Self-distributing a WordPress theme offers significant control and branding opportunities. It allows for complete management over distribution and updates, direct revenue without intermediaries, and targeted marketing strategies.

But this approach means you have full responsibility for updates, user trust building, secure payment setups (if selling your theme), and comprehensive customer support.

To successfully self-distribute, focus on creating a secure, user-friendly website, and employ reliable e-commerce solutions if you plan to charge for distribution of your theme. A strong marketing strategy is essential for visibility, while exceptional customer support and regular updates based on user feedback will enhance your theme’s reputation. Navigating these challenges is important to create a successful presence outside the WordPress Theme Directory.

### Hosting your theme on GitHub

Hosting your WordPress theme on [GitHub](https://github.com/) appeals to developers for its version control, collaboration features, and community engagement opportunities. It offers transparency and trust through open-source access, along with free hosting and effective issue tracking. Its developer-centric nature can limit exposure to non-technical audiences. It also lacks a direct update mechanism, posing challenges in user support (though, there are plugins that make updates possible).

Best practices for GitHub hosting include maintaining clear documentation, engaging with the community, regular updates, and leveraging GitHub Pages. GitHub can be a powerful platform for collaborative theme development and distribution when used effectively.

### Hosting your theme on third-party marketplaces

Hosting your WordPress theme on third-party marketplaces provides visibility and access to a diverse user base, from individual bloggers to enterprise clients. These platforms offer credibility through quality standards, marketing support, and potential for high financial returns due to their professional clientele.

However, challenges include intense competition, fees and revenue sharing, adherence to marketplace guidelines, limited direct customer interaction, and dependence on the platform’s policies.

When hosting on third-party marketplaces, it is important to understand the audience, focus on creating high-quality theme, stay informed about marketplace policies, optimize your theme for visibility, and more. While navigating these marketplaces requires balancing their benefits and constraints, they can be a valuable avenue for distributing your WordPress theme to a large audience.

# Patterns <a name="themes/patterns" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/patterns/

Patterns are one of the most useful tools for theme development, allowing you to reuse groups of blocks across a wide variety of scenarios. Over time, you will likely use patterns more than any other theme feature available in WordPress.

In this chapter, you will learn what patterns are and dive into the various use cases where you will apply them in your themes. This will include everything from providing insertable layouts to your theme users to running PHP for loading assets and even more.

# Introduction to Patterns <a name="themes/patterns/introduction-to-patterns" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/patterns/introduction-to-patterns/

Block patterns (“patterns,” for short) are one of the most powerful features at a theme author’s disposal. Introduced in WordPress 5.4, patterns made it easier for users to insert more complex layouts from the block editor while opening a world of possibilities to designers.

This article provides an overarching definition of what patterns are and how they work. This will serve as a foundation as you read through the other articles in this chapter.

## What are patterns?

Essentially, a pattern is nothing more than one or more blocks that have been pre-configured and presented to the end-user. Think of them as reusable groups of blocks.

And that’s it. *Really.* Patterns are just groups of blocks.

They are ideal as starting points for users to insert into their post and page content, but they are also useful when used inside of templates.

Users can insert them directly into a template from the Site Editor or into their content from the Post Editor:

[![WordPress editor with the Patterns inserter panel open. The Page sub-panel is open and shows a list of page patterns.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/pattern-inserter.jpg?resize=2048%2C1019&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/pattern-inserter.jpg?ssl=1)In comparison to template parts, which is a similar feature for reusable groups of blocks, patterns also give you access to PHP when you bundle them inside a theme. This means that you can internationalize text within them, dynamically add URLs to include images, and more. And you will learn more about these things throughout this chapter.

Note that users can create and manage custom patterns from the **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Patterns** screen in the admin. You can also use this screen to manage your own patterns in your development install:

[![Pattern library in the WordPress site editor, which shows a 4-column grid of all available patterns.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/pattern-libary.jpg?resize=2048%2C1060&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/pattern-libary.jpg?ssl=1)

If you are building a classic theme, this screen is unavailable. But, as of WordPress 6.5, you can access patterns through the **Appearance &gt; Patterns** screen instead.

## Types of patterns

Essentially, there are two types of patterns:

- **Synced:** Patterns that remain unchanged regardless of how many times or where it’s used on the website. These were formerly called “reusable blocks” in older versions of WordPress. *Note: these can only be created and managed from the WordPress admin.*
- **Not synced:** Patterns that, when inserted via the Block Editor, create a new instance of the pattern’s blocks. Any changes made to the inserted blocks do not affect other uses of the pattern. Changes to the pattern in the future also do not affect prior uses of it.

By the nature of how the pattern system works, all patterns registered by the theme are of the **Not synced** type. There is an [open ticket for syncing theme-registered patterns](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/59272), but it is not currently possible.

## Managing patterns in the WordPress admin

Even when building a theme, you will often build patterns directly from the admin before bundling and registering them from within the theme itself. This can also be a good way to store and manage your patterns locally until you are satisfied that they are ready to include in your theme.

It’s also good practice to get a feel for how users interact with patterns.

You can manage patterns by visiting the **Appearance &gt; Editor** screen in your WordPress admin and clicking on the **Patterns** item in the sidebar.

### Creating custom patterns

On the **Patterns** screen, you must click on the **Create pattern** button (**+** icon), which will give you a choice to create several options:

- Create pattern
- Create template part
- Import pattern from JSON

Select the **Create pattern** option, which will trigger an overlay modal that looks like this:

[![WordPress pattern library with the "Create pattern" modal overlaying the screen. It has name, categories, and synced fields.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/create-pattern-modal.webp?resize=2048%2C1060&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/create-pattern-modal.webp?ssl=1)You’ll need to fill out three fields:

- **Name:** Decide on a name for the pattern you are creating.
- **Categories:** Add one or more categories that your pattern will fit into.
- **Synced:** Decide on whether your pattern should be synced. If you plan to ship this with your theme, you should toggle this option off just so that it behaves the same as it would coming from a theme.

Once you click the **Create** button, it will take you to the Pattern Editor. From there, it works just like any other Editor in WordPress. Add the blocks that you want to in your pattern and adjust their settings and styles to suit your needs.

Here is an example of a basic “Welcome Hero” pattern:

[![WordPress pattern editor that shows a basic Cover block with a black background and white demo text in the content area.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/pattern-editor.webp?resize=2048%2C1060&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/pattern-editor.webp?ssl=1)Just be sure to hit the **Save** button. From there, you can use your pattern just like you’d use any other pattern on your site.

You can also view and edit any custom patterns you’ve created via the **Patterns &gt; My Patterns** section in the sidebar:

[![WordPress pattern library with the "My patterns" sub-panel selected. It shows a single pattern that has been created by the user.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/my-patterns.webp?resize=2048%2C1060&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/my-patterns.webp?ssl=1)The **My Patterns** section is always where any user-created patterns will appear in the WordPress admin. They will also appear under the **All patterns** section and any other categories they were assigned to.

### Copying a pattern to your theme

The Editor interface is a nice and easy method for creating patterns. But this is the Theme Handbook, so you’re probably wanting to know how to bundle this pattern that you’ve created with your theme.

For that, you need to copy the pattern code itself. You’ll learn what to do with pattern code in the [Registering Patterns](#themes/patterns/registering-patterns) article in this chapter.

There are a few different methods for copying pattern code. But the easiest way is to click the **Options** button (**⋮** icon) at the top of the editor and select the **Copy all blocks** option in the dropdown menu:

[![WordPress pattern editor with a simple pattern of a Cover block with black background and white text shown in the content area. The editor options dropdown menu is shown with the "Copy all blocks" menu item highlighted.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/copy-pattern.webp?resize=2048%2C1060&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/copy-pattern.webp?ssl=1)For the particular pattern shown in the screenshot, it will give you this block markup:

```markup
<!-- wp:cover {"overlayColor":"contrast","align":"full"} -->
<div class="wp-block-cover alignfull"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-contrast-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim"></span><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container"><!-- wp:group {"style":{"spacing":{"blockGap":"2.5rem"}},"layout":{"type":"constrained","wideSize":"%","contentSize":"75%"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Welcome to My Site</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">This is my little home away from home. Here, you will get to know me. I'll share my likes, hobbies, and more. Every now and then, I'll even have something interesting to say in a blog post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:buttons {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-buttons"><!-- wp:button {"className":"is-style-outline"} -->
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button">See My Popular Posts <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">→</span>︎</a></div>
<!-- /wp:button --></div>
<!-- /wp:buttons --></div>
<!-- /wp:group --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:cover -->
```

In the [Registering Patterns](#themes/patterns/registering-patterns) documentation, you will learn how to take that block markup and bundle it as a pattern with your theme.

## Managing theme-bundled patterns

There is currently no standard for theme authors to manage their patterns or port them directly to their theme without going through the process outlined above.

For the moment, it’s entirely up to you to decide how you want to integrate pattern management into your workflow. Some things to consider:

- You’ll need to manually copy and paste a pattern’s block markup from the admin UI to your theme.
- If you need to make changes to a pattern’s block markup, there’s no way to keep the pattern in your theme and the version you built in the admin in sync.

These are certainly challenges that you’ll encounter when deciding the best method to use. There is an [open discussion](https://github.com/WordPress/create-block-theme/issues/287) for the official Create Block Theme plugin that would explore pattern management, and that is the best place to discuss with other theme authors the best path forward.

# Registering Patterns <a name="themes/patterns/registering-patterns" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/patterns/registering-patterns/

In [Introduction to Patterns](#themes/patterns/introduction-to-patterns), you learned how to create patterns from the WordPress admin interface. Now it’s time to learn how to add these custom patterns directly to your theme

This article will show you how to take a pattern’s block code and register it with WordPress from within your theme. It will also cover unregistering patterns and registering/unregistering pattern categories.

## Creating patterns

If you’re unfamiliar with creating custom patterns, take a moment to study the [Introduction to Patterns](#themes/patterns/registering-patterns) guide, which will walk you through the process.

Your pattern can be anything you like, but for the purposes of this article, the code shared below will be of a core Cover block with some blocks nested within it, following this structure:

- Group 
    - Heading
    - Paragraph
    - Buttons 
        - Button

Feel free to try recreating this yourself from the editor, especially if you are just getting used to working with the editor. Here is a screenshot of the pattern from the editor:

[![WordPress pattern editor that shows a basic Cover block with a black background and white demo text in the content area.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/pattern-editor.webp?resize=2048%2C1060&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/pattern-editor.webp?ssl=1)You can also customize this however you like, but it’s recommended to keep this relatively simple for your first time creating a pattern.

Here is what the above pattern’s block markup looks like (read the [Introduction to Patterns](#themes/patterns/introduction-to-patterns) article for more information on getting pattern code):

```markup
<!-- wp:cover {"overlayColor":"contrast","align":"full"} -->
<div class="wp-block-cover alignfull"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-contrast-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim"></span><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container"><!-- wp:group {"style":{"spacing":{"blockGap":"2.5rem"}},"layout":{"type":"constrained","wideSize":"%","contentSize":"75%"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Welcome to My Site</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">This is my little home away from home. Here, you will get to know me.  I'll share my likes, hobbies, and more.  Every now and then, I'll even have something interesting to say in a blog post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:buttons {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-buttons"><!-- wp:button {"className":"is-style-outline"} -->
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button">See My Popular Posts <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">→</span>︎</a></div>
<!-- /wp:button --></div>
<!-- /wp:buttons --></div>
<!-- /wp:group --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:cover -->
```

For the remainder of this article, you will work with this same pattern, learning how to register it, unregister it, and customize it further.

It’s good practice to wrap most patterns in a Group, Cover, or other container block (i.e., a block that allows nested blocks). This makes it easier for your theme users to move the entire pattern around in the editor. You can also add a CSS class to this outer block for any custom styling that applies to the entire pattern.

## Registering patterns

There are two methods for registering block patterns in WordPress:

- By placing files with block markup in them into the /patterns folder in your theme.
- By manually calling the `register_block_pattern()` function.

The most straightforward route is the first. You’ll learn how to do both in the next sections, but this handbook will recommend using the `/patterns` folder except in some edge cases.

### Using the /patterns directory to register patterns

WordPress will recognize any pattern file placed in your theme’s `/patterns` folder, and it will automatically register it for you, provided that it has a valid pattern file header.

A [file header](https://codex.wordpress.org/File_Header) is PHP-commented code with a list of key + value pairs at the top of a file. WordPress parses this information to gather metadata. In this case, the metadata is used to register a block pattern.

For pattern file headers, these are the keys that you can set:

- **`Title`:** A human-readable title that can be translated.
- **`Slug`:** A namespaced slug that is unique to your pattern in the form of `namespace/pattern-name`.
- **`Categories`:** A comma-separated list of categories in which the pattern belongs.
- **`Description`:** The long description of the registered pattern. Only shown to screen readers.
- **`Viewport Width`:** The width of the `<iframe>` viewport when previewing the pattern (in pixels).
- **`Inserter`:** Whether to show the pattern in the inserter. Defaults to `true`.
- **`Keywords`:** A comma-separated list of keywords related to the pattern. Used when a user searches in the inserter.
- **`Block Types`:** A comma-separated list of block types to associate the pattern with (e.g., `core/cover`, `core/post-content`).
- **`Post Types`:** A comma-separated list of post types in which to limit the pattern (e.g., `post`, `page`). Defaults to all post types.
- **`Template Types`:** A comma-separated list of template types the pattern fits with (e.g., `home`, `single`).

For most patterns, you should at least add the Title, Slug, and Categories fields. Pattern files should look like this:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Hero
 * Slug: themeslug/hero
 * Categories: featured
 */
?>
<!-- Pattern code goes here. -->
```

Now let’s add the code that you copied from the previous section into the `/patterns/hero.php` file in your theme:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Hero
 * Slug: themeslug/hero
 * Categories: featured
 */
?>
<!-- wp:cover {"overlayColor":"contrast","align":"full"} -->
<div class="wp-block-cover alignfull"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-contrast-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim"></span><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container"><!-- wp:group {"style":{"spacing":{"blockGap":"2.5rem"}},"layout":{"type":"constrained","wideSize":"%","contentSize":"75%"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Welcome to My Site</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">This is my little home away from home. Here, you will get to know me. I'll share my likes, hobbies, and more. Every now and then, I'll even have something interesting to say in a blog post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:buttons {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-buttons"><!-- wp:button {"className":"is-style-outline"} -->
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button">See My Popular Posts <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">→</span>︎</a></div>
<!-- /wp:button --></div>
<!-- /wp:buttons --></div>
<!-- /wp:group --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:cover -->
```

Now if you add or edit a new post in WordPress, you should see your pattern listed in the inserter. Click the **Patterns** tab and select **Featured**:

[![WordPress post editor with the Patterns inserter open. The Featured sub-panel is selected and shows a single pattern.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/patterns-insert-custom.webp?resize=2048%2C924&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/patterns-insert-custom.webp?ssl=1)You should also be able to see your pattern listed under **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Patterns** in the WordPress admin.

### Using PHP to register patterns

Instead of using the `/patterns` folder to auto-register your patterns, you may choose to manually register them via PHP. You can mix and match both registration methods, but an individual pattern must be registered with only one method.

To register block patterns with PHP, you must use the [`register_block_pattern()`](#reference/functions/register_block_pattern) function. Here is what its signature looks like:

```php
register_block_pattern( 
	string $pattern_name, 
	array $pattern_properties 
): bool
```

The function accepts two parameters and returns `true` or `false`, depending on whether the pattern was successfully registered:

- **`$pattern_name`:** A namespaced slug that is unique to your pattern in the form of `namespace/pattern-name`.
- **`$pattern_properties`:**
    - **`content`:** The block markup for the pattern.
    - **`title`:** A human-readable title that can be translated.
    - **`categories`:** An array of categories in which the pattern belongs.
    - **`description`:** The long description of the registered pattern. Only shown to screen readers.
    - **`viewportWidth`:** The width of the `<iframe>` viewport when previewing the pattern (in pixels).
    - **`inserter`:** Whether to show the pattern in the inserter. Defaults to `true`.
    - **`keywords`:** An array of keywords related to the pattern. Used when a user searches in the inserter.
    - **`blockTypes`:** An array of block types to associate the pattern with.
    - **`postTypes`:** An array of post types in which to limit the pattern. Defaults to all post types.
    - **`source`:** The source for the registered pattern. This should be set to `theme` since the pattern is coming from a theme.
    - **`templateTypes`:** An array of template types the pattern fits with.

When registering patterns via PHP, you should do so on the `init` hook. Now try registering your custom pattern by adding this code in `functions.php` (be sure to add your custom markup to the `content` property):

```php
add_action( 'init', 'themeslug_register_patterns' );

function themeslug_register_patterns() {
	register_block_pattern( 'themeslug/hero', array(
		'title'      => __( 'Hero', 'themeslug' ),
		'categories' => array( 'featured' ),
		'source'     => 'theme',
		'content'    => '<!-- Block pattern goes here. -->'
	) );
}
```

### Conditionally registering patterns

If you need to conditionally register an entire pattern, there are two methods to choose from, depending on how you prefer to register patterns.

#### Conditionally registering patterns in the /patterns folder

If you have used the auto-registration method of placing your pattern in your theme’s `/patterns` folder, there is no true way to conditionally register it. What you must do in this case is unregister the pattern.

Suppose that you wanted to only make the hero pattern you registered earlier available if the `core/paragraph` block is registered. In a real-world scenario, you’d likely be checking for a third-party block, and the `core/paragraph` block is used only for the sake of this example.

Try this code inside of your `functions.php` file to unregister your previously-registered pattern:

```php
add_action( 'init', 'themeslug_unregister_patterns', 999 );

function themeslug_unregister_patterns() {
	if ( WP_Block_Type_Registry::get_instance()->is_registered( 'core/paragraph' ) ) {
		unregister_block_pattern( 'themeslug/hero' );
	}
}
```

The above code uses the [`WP_Block_Type_Registry`](#reference/classes/wp_block_type_registry) class, which stores all block types that are registered on the server-side with WordPress. Using the class’s [`is_registered()`](#reference/classes/wp_block_type_registryis_registered/) method, you can determine whether a block is registered.

#### Conditionally registering patterns via [register\_block\_pattern()](#reference/functions/register_block_pattern) 

If you manually registered your patterns via PHP, you only need to wrap your call to `register_block_pattern()` with your conditional check.

Using the same example as above, try only registering your pattern if the `core/paragraph` block is registered by adding this to `functions.php`:

```php
add_action( 'init', 'themeslug_register_patterns', 999 );

function themeslug_register_patterns() {
	if ( WP_Block_Type_Registry::get_instance()->is_registered( 'core/paragraph' ) ) {
		register_block_pattern( 'themeslug/hero', array(
			'title'      => __( 'Hero', 'themeslug' ),
			'categories' => array( 'featured' ),
			'source'     => 'theme',
			'content'    => '<!-- Block pattern goes here. -->'
		) );
	}
}
```

## Unregistering patterns

There are times when you need to unregister block patterns so that they do not appear in the inserter for users. For example, you may want to remove some of the core WordPress patterns, those added by a parent theme (if you’re building a child theme), or those added by third-party plugins.

When you need to unregister a single block pattern, you’ll use the [`unregister_block_pattern()`](#reference/functions/unregister_block_pattern) function:

```php
unregister_block_pattern( string $pattern_name ): bool
```

Like when registering patterns, you’ll also want to unregister on the `init` hook. Because patterns are generally (but not always) registered with the default priority `10` on `init`, you’ll want to use a higher priority so that your code runs later.

Try unregistering your custom pattern from earlier by adding this code to your `functions.php` file:

```php
add_action( 'init', 'themeslug_unregister_patterns', 999 );

function themeslug_unregister_patterns() {
	unregister_block_pattern( 'themeslug/hero' );
}
```

### Removing Core patterns

While you can use `unregister_block_pattern()` to unregister individual core WordPress patterns, you can also choose to get rid of all of them by removing support for the core-block-patterns feature.

To remove all core WordPress patterns, add this code to your theme’s `functions.php` file:

```php
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'themeslug_remove_core_patterns' );

function themeslug_remove_core_patterns() {
	remove_theme_support( 'core-block-patterns' );
}
```

### Disabling remote patterns

WordPress also automatically loads some patterns remotely from the official [Pattern Directory](https://wordpress.org/patterns/) on WordPress.org. There are some situations where you might not want to load these patterns, such as when they don’t match your theme design. You may also want to opt out of calling a remote API on a site that you’re building for a client. Whatever the case, you can disable this by filtering the [`should_load_remote_block_patterns`](#reference/hooks/should_load_remote_block_patterns) hook.

To disable remote patterns, add this code to your `functions.php` file:

```php
add_filter( 'should_load_remote_block_patterns', '__return_false' );
```

## Pattern categories

WordPress has several block pattern categories that it registers by default:

- `featured`
- `about`
- `audio` (added in WordPress 6.4)
- `banner`
- `buttons`
- `call-to-action`
- `columns`
- `contact`
- `footer`
- `gallery`
- `header`
- `media`
- `portfolio`
- `posts`
- `query` (use `posts` instead)
- `services`
- `team`
- `testimonials`
- `text`
- `video` (added in WordPress 6.4)

It’s generally best to use these default categories for your theme. This keeps a consistent UI that users will be accustomed to. But there are times when you may want to add your own categories or even remove those that are already registered.

In this section of the article, you’ll learn how to both register and unregister custom block pattern categories.

### Registering a pattern category

To register a custom category for putting one or more of your patterns into, you must use the [`register_block_pattern_category()`](#reference/functions/register_block_pattern_category) function:

```php
register_block_pattern_category( 
	string $category_name, 
	array $category_properties 
): bool
```

The function accepts two parameters:

- **`$category_name`:** A unique ID/slug for the category. It’s good practice to prefix this with your theme slug (e.g., `themeslug-category-name`).
- **`$category_properties`:** An array of properties for defining further data about the category: 
    - **`label`:** A human-readable label/title for the category that may be translated.
    - **`description`:** A description for the category that may be translated.

Try adding a new custom pattern category for your theme. Add this code to your theme’s `functions.php` file:

```php
add_action( 'init', 'themeslug_register_pattern_categories' );

function themeslug_register_pattern_categories() {
	register_block_pattern_category( 'themeslug/custom', array( 
		'label'       => __( 'Theme Name: Custom', 'themeslug' ),
		'description' => __( 'Custom patterns for Theme Name.', 'themeslug' )
	) );
}
```

Now try adding the `themeslug/custom` category to any block pattern:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Hero
 * Slug: themeslug/hero
 * Categories: featured, themeslug/custom
 */
?>
<!-- Your block markup goes here. -->
```

Any registered patterns for this category will now appear in the inserter and under **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Patterns** (**Appearance &gt; Patterns** for classic themes):

[![WordPress Pattern library in the Site Editor. It shows a custom category selected, which has a single pattern preview.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/custom-pattern-category.webp?resize=2048%2C1060&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/custom-pattern-category.webp?ssl=1)### Unregistering a pattern category

To unregister a registered pattern category, you must use the [`unregister_block_pattern_category()`](#reference/functions/unregister_block_pattern_category) function:

```php
unregister_block_pattern_category( string $category_name ): bool
```

The function accepts a single parameter:

- **`$category_name`:** The name (i.e., slug) of the registered category to unregister.

Try adding this code to your `functions.php` to remove the `themeslug/custom` category you registered in the previous step:

```php
add_action( 'init', 'themeslug_unregister_pattern_categories' );

function themeslug_unregister_pattern_categories() {
	register_block_pattern_category( 'themeslug/custom' );
}
```

# Using PHP in Patterns <a name="themes/patterns/using-php-in-patterns" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/patterns/using-php-in-patterns/

One of the biggest advantages of patterns over features like templates and template parts is that you can use PHP in them, which opens a world of possibilities for what you can accomplish. However, there are limits on what functionality is available to your patterns.

In this article, you will learn the limitations of the patterns system, when and how you can use PHP, and some of the most common use cases for dynamic functionality.

## Patterns are registered on init

When using PHP in patterns, it’s important to understand when the pattern’s block markup is actually compiled versus when it is rendered.

Pattern registration happens on the [`init`](#reference/hooks/init) hook. At this point, WordPress compiles the content of the pattern and saves a copy of it as HTML-based block markup. This allows it to be used in both the editor and the front end. It’s during this registration process where the pattern can execute PHP code.

A pattern’s block markup is not actually rendered until it is used either in the editor or on the front end. However, the block markup is plain HTML at the time it is rendered.

At a practical level, this means that a lot of data is unavailable during the registration process on `init`. Your patterns cannot access things like the global query or post. They also cannot use functions associated with that data. So this means that WordPress functions like `is_home()`, `is_single()`, `get_post()`, and others are simply not ready yet.

For example, this PHP wouldn’t execute correctly in a pattern:

```php
<?php if ( is_page() ) : ?>
	<!-- wp:paragraph -->
	<p><?php the_title(); ?></p>
	<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<?php endif; ?>
```

Neither the `is_page()` nor the `the_title()` functions have the global data they need when a pattern is registered, so they won’t work.

If you’re accustomed to building classic themes, this can feel very unintuitive, especially if you’ve been equating PHP-based patterns to classic, PHP-based template parts.

There are other methods for executing PHP at the time of render, such as using the [Block Bindings API](#news/tag/block-bindings). But those methods are outside the scope of pattern documentation.

You still have a wide and wonderful range of PHP functions and many WordPress functions available to you. And you’ll learn more about what you *can* use in the upcoming sections of this article.

## An example pattern

For the rest of this article, let’s use a single pattern that begins as mostly HTML. Then, you’ll walk through adding PHP to dynamically handle some portions of it.

Create a new file named `patterns/hero.php` in your theme and put this code into it:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Hero
 * Slug: themeslug/hero
 * Categories: featured
 */
?>
<!-- wp:cover {"overlayColor":"contrast","isUserOverlayColor":true,"align":"full"} -->
<div class="wp-block-cover alignfull">
	<span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-contrast-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim"></span>
	<div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
		
		<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Welcome to My Site</h2>
		<!-- /wp:heading -->

		<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
		<p class="has-text-align-center">This is my little home away from home.</p>
		<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

		<!-- wp:buttons {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
		<div class="wp-block-buttons">
			<!-- wp:button {"className":"wp-block-button is-style-outline"} -->
			<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button">Button A</a></div>
			<!-- /wp:button -->
			<!-- wp:button {"className":"wp-block-button is-style-outline"} -->
			<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button">Button B</a></div>
			<!-- /wp:button -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:buttons -->

	</div>
</div>
<!-- /wp:cover -->
```

If you insert it the pattern into the editor, it should look like this:

[![WordPress post editor with a "Welcome to My Site" message in white text with a black background. It is wrapped in a Cover block.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/php-pattern-default.jpg?resize=2048%2C1060&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/php-pattern-default.jpg?ssl=1)## Internationalizing text in patterns

One of the primary use cases for block patterns is [internationalizing text](#themes/functionality/internationalization) (making it ready for translation). For example, if you have text in a template or template part, the only way to internationalize that text is to move it into a pattern, where you have full access to PHP.

Because pattern files are just PHP, you can use any of the internationalization functions within WordPress. In the below example, you’ll use [`esc_html_e()`](#reference/functions/esc_html_e) to both escape the text for security and make it ready for translators.

Let’s look at the Heading block from your Hero pattern:

```markup
<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Welcome to My Site</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
```

As you can see, the “Welcome to My Site” text in the Heading block is not internationalized. When shipping your theme to users all around the world who speak many different languages, it’s important to ensure this text can be translated.

To internationalize the Heading block’s text, you must wrap it in an internationalization function (`esc_html_e()` in this case). So you’d change the block markup to look like this:

```php
<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><?php esc_html_e( 'Welcome to My Site', 'themeslug' ); ?></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
```

There are three other places where you should also make these changes. The first is to the Paragraph block text, and then the two Button blocks. Your new `patterns/hero.php` file should look like this:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Hero
 * Slug: themeslug/hero
 * Categories: featured
 */
?>
<!-- wp:cover {"overlayColor":"contrast","isUserOverlayColor":true,"align":"full"} -->
<div class="wp-block-cover alignfull">
	<span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-contrast-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim"></span>
	<div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
		
		<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><?php esc_html_e( 'Welcome to My Site', 'themeslug' ); ?></h2>
		<!-- /wp:heading -->

		<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
		<p class="has-text-align-center"><?php esc_html_e( 'This is my little home away from home.', 'themeslug' ); ?></p>
		<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

		<!-- wp:buttons {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
		<div class="wp-block-buttons">
			<!-- wp:button {"className":"wp-block-button is-style-outline"} -->
			<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php esc_html_e( 'Button A', 'themeslug' ); ?></a></div>
			<!-- /wp:button -->
			<!-- wp:button {"className":"wp-block-button is-style-outline"} -->
			<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php esc_html_e( 'Button B', 'themeslug' ); ?></a></div>
			<!-- /wp:button -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:buttons -->

	</div>
</div>
<!-- /wp:cover -->
```

## Using images and other assets

Adding dynamic URLs for images and other assets is another important feature of patterns. Because you have PHP access, you can use functions like [`get_theme_file_uri()`](#reference/functions/get_theme_file_uri) to output an image URL that’s bundled with your theme, for example.

Try adding an image background to your “hero” pattern’s Cover block. If you need an image, try grabbing one from the WordPress [Photo Directory](https://wordpress.org/photos/) (the example below uses this [Nepal night scene photo](https://wordpress.org/photos/photo/41664fab9b/)).

Download an image and save it to your theme’s `/assets/images` folder (or a folder of your choice) and name it `hero-background.jpg`.

Then open your pattern in the editor and upload the image as the background for the Cover block in your Hero pattern, which should look like this:

[![WordPress post editor with a Cover block that has a background image of a nighttime city. There is a welcome message and buttons overlaying the background.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/php-pattern-dynamic-background.webp?resize=2048%2C1060&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/php-pattern-dynamic-background.webp?ssl=1)If you copy the blocks that make up the pattern, you’ll notice that you have two instances of the image URL in your pattern code. It will be a hardcoded URL similar to this:

```markup
http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/hero-background.jpg
```

You need to change both of those instances so that they point to the image that is located in your theme’s `/assets/images` folder. For this, you need do two things:

- Get the correct URL using a function like [`get_theme_file_uri()`](#reference/functions/get_theme_file_uri).
- Escape the URL so that it’s safe for output with [`esc_url()`](#reference/functions/esc_url).

Change the hard coded image URLs to this:

```php
<?php echo esc_url( get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/images/hero-background.jpg' ) ); ?>
```

Your final pattern code should look like this (note that this example includes internationalized text as explained in the previous section):

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Hero
 * Slug: themeslug/hero
 * Categories: featured
 */
?>
<!-- wp:cover {"url":"<?php echo esc_url( get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/images/hero-background.jpg' ) ); ?>","id":3838,"dimRatio":50,"overlayColor":"contrast","align":"full"} -->
<div class="wp-block-cover alignfull">
	<span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-contrast-background-color has-background-dim"></span>
	<img class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-3838" alt="" src="<?php echo esc_url( get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/images/hero-background.jpg' ) ); ?>" data-object-fit="cover"/>
	<div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
		
		<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><?php esc_html_e( 'Welcome to My Site', 'themeslug' ); ?></h2>
		<!-- /wp:heading -->

		<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
		<p class="has-text-align-center"><?php esc_html_e( 'This is my little home away from home.', 'themeslug' ); ?></p>
		<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

		<!-- wp:buttons {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
		<div class="wp-block-buttons">
			<!-- wp:button {"className":"wp-block-button is-style-outline"} -->
			<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php esc_html_e( 'Button A', 'themeslug' ); ?></a></div>
			<!-- /wp:button -->
			<!-- wp:button {"className":"wp-block-button is-style-outline"} -->
			<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php esc_html_e( 'Button B', 'themeslug' ); ?></a></div>
			<!-- /wp:button -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:buttons -->

	</div>
</div>
<!-- /wp:cover -->
```

## foreach() loops

You have access to nearly every PHP function and feature at your disposal, and many things will undoubtedly be useful to you as you build themes. But `foreach()` loops are likely one of the features that you will often reach for.

`foreach()` loops are particularly useful in patterns that have repeated blocks. For example, in your `patterns/hero.php` file, you have a set of two Button blocks:

```php
<!-- wp:button {"className":"wp-block-button is-style-outline"} -->
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php esc_html_e( 'Button A', 'themeslug' ); ?></a></div>
<!-- /wp:button -->

<!-- wp:button {"className":"wp-block-button is-style-outline"} -->
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php esc_html_e( 'Button B', 'themeslug' ); ?></a></div>
<!-- /wp:button -->
```

One of the foundational principles of development is DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). And this code breaks that principle. With a single `foreach()` loop, you can create the block markup once and loop through it.

First, you need an array of items to loop through, which is the Button content itself. At the top of your `patterns/hero.php` file before the closing `?>` tag, add an array of labels:

```php
$buttons = array(
	__( 'Button A', 'themeslug' ),
	__( 'Button B', 'themeslug' )
);
```

Then replace the markup for your two Button blocks with this code:

```php
<?php foreach ( $buttons as $button ) : ?>
	<!-- wp:button {"className":"wp-block-button is-style-outline"} -->
	<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php echo esc_html( $button ); ?></a></div>
	<!-- /wp:button -->
<?php endforeach; ?>
```

Your full `patterns/hero.php` file should now look like the following (note this includes both the internationalized text and dynamic image example code from earlier):

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Hero
 * Slug: themeslug/hero
 * Categories: featured
 */

$buttons = array(
	__( 'Button A', 'themeslug' ),
	__( 'Button B', 'themeslug' )
);

?>
<!-- wp:cover {"url":"<?php echo esc_url( get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/images/hero-background.jpg' ) ); ?>","id":3838,"dimRatio":50,"overlayColor":"contrast","align":"full"} -->
<div class="wp-block-cover alignfull">
	<span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-contrast-background-color has-background-dim"></span>
	<img class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-3838" alt="" src="<?php echo esc_url( get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/images/hero-background.jpg' ) ); ?>" data-object-fit="cover"/>
	<div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
		
		<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><?php esc_html_e( 'Welcome to My Site', 'themeslug' ); ?></h2>
		<!-- /wp:heading -->

		<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
		<p class="has-text-align-center"><?php esc_html_e( 'This is my little home away from home.', 'themslug' ); ?></p>
		<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

		<!-- wp:buttons {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
		<div class="wp-block-buttons">
			<?php foreach ( $buttons as $button ) : ?>
				<!-- wp:button {"className":"wp-block-button is-style-outline"} -->
				<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php echo esc_html( $button ); ?></a></div>
				<!-- /wp:button -->
			<?php endforeach; ?>
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:buttons -->

	</div>
</div>
<!-- /wp:cover -->
```

At this point, your pattern is fully dynamic. As you dive deeper into pattern development, you’ll come up with even more use cases for using PHP. Think of this article as just the foundation that you’ll build from.

# Usage in Templates <a name="themes/patterns/usage-in-templates" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/patterns/usage-in-templates/

When building themes, patterns are not merely reusable sections of blocks that users can add to their content. That is a nice feature, but the true power of patterns is using them directly in your theme’s front-end output.

In this article, you will learn both why and how to include patterns in your theme’s templates and template parts.

## Why use patterns in templates?

There are two primary reasons to use patterns in your templates:

- **PHP access:** Block templates and template parts are HTML files and you need access to various PHP functions for dynamic functionality. You can learn more about this in the [Using PHP in Patterns](#themes/patterns/using-php-in-patterns) documentation.
- **The DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle:** When building any type of software (themes included) you should always reuse code when possible, which means less work for you and fewer potential bugs. Because patterns are reusable groups of blocks, it makes sense to use the pattern instead of rewriting the code in your templates and parts.

This article will primarily focus on the last point. You will learn how to reuse your patterns within your theme’s block templates and template parts.

One of the best use cases is to create patterns of common elements across multiple templates. For example, if your Home, Archive, and Search templates all include the same Query Loop layout, create a pattern for that design and include it in each template.

## The Pattern block

As described in [Introduction to Patterns](#themes/patterns/introduction-to-patterns), a block pattern is merely one or more blocks that you have registered as a pattern. However, there is also a block named Pattern available in WordPress. You won’t find the Pattern block anywhere in the UI (such as the block inserter). It’s primarily meant to be used in WordPress themes.

Here is what the Pattern block markup looks like:

```markup
<!-- wp:pattern {"slug":"namespace/pattern-slug"} /-->
```

As you can see, it looks just like any other block markup. The big difference is that you must set the `slug` parameter to include a specific pattern. The value must include both the pattern namespace and slug.

Whenever you want to include a pattern within a template or template part, you only need to call the Pattern block.

You can also include patterns registered by WordPress or plugins in templates, not just those from your theme. All you need to do is reference the correct `slug` value when calling the Pattern block.

## Adding a pattern to a template

In this section, you will walk through a practical example of including a pattern within a template.

Assume you had a “hero” pattern that you have registered for your theme because you want users to be able to insert it anywhere they need to. But you also want to include this in your Home template by default.

First, register a custom pattern with the `themeslug/hero`, as described in the [Registering Patterns](#themes/patterns/registering-patterns) documentation. Create a new file named `hero.php` and place it into your theme’s `/patterns` folder with this code:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Hero
 * Slug: themeslug/hero
 * Categories: featured
 */
?>
<!-- wp:cover {"overlayColor":"contrast","isUserOverlayColor":true,"align":"full"} -->
<div class="wp-block-cover alignfull">
	<span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-contrast-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim"></span>
	<div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
		
		<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
		<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><?php esc_html_e( 'Welcome to My Site', 'themeslug' ); ?></h2>
		<!-- /wp:heading -->

		<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
		<p class="has-text-align-center"><?php esc_html_e( 'This is my little home away from home.', 'themeslug' ); ?></p>
		<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

		<!-- wp:buttons {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
		<div class="wp-block-buttons">
			<!-- wp:button {"className":"wp-block-button is-style-outline"} -->
			<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php esc_html_e( 'Button A', 'themeslug' ); ?></a></div>
			<!-- /wp:button -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:buttons -->

	</div>
</div>
<!-- /wp:cover -->
```

This will make the pattern both available to users via the UI and to your theme templates for inclusion.

To include this specific pattern in a template, you need to call it like so:

```markup
<!-- wp:pattern {"slug":"themeslug/hero"} /-->
```

Now try adding it to one of your theme’s templates, such as `/templates/home.html` or `/templates/index.html` below the header. Your template with the pattern code should look similar to this:

```markup
<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"header"} /-->

<!-- wp:pattern {"slug":"themeslug/hero"} /-->

<!-- Some other blocks. /-->

<!-- wp:template-part {"slug":"footer"} /-->
```

Now test the addition of the pattern in the Site Editor by going to **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Templates** and choosing the template you added it to:

[![WordPress Site Editor with the Home/Blog template open. It shows a Header template part and a "welcome" message in a Cover block at the top of the template.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/template-home-pattern.webp?resize=2048%2C1061&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/template-home-pattern.webp?ssl=1)The pattern should also appear on the front end of your site when that template is in use.

From this point, you can use this feature however you need. Whether you’re including a pattern in a template or template part, the process is the same.

# Starter Patterns <a name="themes/patterns/starter-patterns" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/patterns/starter-patterns/

The WordPress block editor is powerful and can handle many different layouts and designs. However, when building a theme, you must remember that not all of your users will be skilled designers or even have much interest in piecing together their own layouts. This is where starter patterns can be beneficial to them.

WordPress supports two types of starter patterns for pages (or any post type) and templates. This feature lets you create starting points for your theme users to build out their pages and templates with minimal skills.

## Starter page patterns

Page patterns let you create custom patterns your theme users can access when adding a new page via **Pages &gt; Add New** in their WordPress admin. From there, a modal will pop up and show them a selection of patterns if any are registered.

Here is what the screen looks like when creating a new page with the default Twenty Twenty-Four theme installed:

[![Modal overlaying the edit page screen, showing a grid of various page layouts.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/starter-page-pattern-tt4.webp?resize=2048%2C1061&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/starter-page-pattern-tt4.webp?ssl=1)This is a powerful feature because it means that you can provide well-designed starting points for your theme’s users or clients. And they don’t need to build from scratch. They only need to select a pattern, and it will automatically be inserted into the content area. From there, they can make any customizations they want.

### How to create a page pattern

Technically, any pattern in your theme can be converted to a page pattern. All you need to do is define the correct parameters to mark it as such. As described in [Registering Patterns](#themes/patterns/registering-patterns), there are two available file header fields that you must set to make this happen:

- **`Block Types`:** Adding `core/post-content` as one of the block types for the pattern tells WordPress that the pattern should be used for the post content.
- **`Post Types`:** You can add one or more post types (separated by commas) to connect the pattern.

With these two fields combined, you create a starter page pattern. Here is what the file header looks like for a fictional `/patterns/example-page.php` pattern file:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Example Page
 * Slug: themeslug/example-page
 * Categories: page
 * Block Types: core/post-content
 * Post Types: page
 * Viewport width: 1376
 */
?>
<!-- Block code here. -->
```

And that’s literally all you must do. Define the pattern’s `Block Types` and `Post Types` parameters and you have a starter page pattern.

This will work with any post type that has opted into the block editor, including both the default `post` and `page` post types.

Because page patterns are actually tied to the content, you wouldn’t typically include something like a site header or footer here. The pattern is output as post content.

## Starter template patterns

Like page patterns, template patterns give users a starting point when building a new template. The difference is that template patterns work from the Site Editor.

If you visit **Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Templates** in your WordPress admin and click the **+** icon button for creating a new template, you should see a new **Add template** modal:

[![WordPress site editing screen with a modal popup asking the user to add a new template.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/add-template.webp?resize=2048%2C1060&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/add-template.webp?ssl=1)From there, you can select the template that you want to create. If the template type has any patterns registered for it, a new **Choose a pattern** modal will appear, overlaying the template-editing interface.

For example, when choosing the **Front Page** option with the default Twenty Twenty-Four theme, you will see this:

[![A modal overlay showing four template options for the homepage from within the WordPress site editor.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/starter-template-patterns-tt4.webp?resize=2048%2C1061&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/starter-template-patterns-tt4.webp?ssl=1)This gives your theme users a really nice onramp for building templates. It means they don’t have to create everything from the ground up and can get started down the right path.

### How to create template type patterns

Unlike page patterns, you will usually not make any of your patterns a template pattern. These are starting points for an entire template, so their use cases are much more limited and specific.

Because template patterns represent an entire template, you would typically include global elements like the header, footer, sidebar, and other sections that your theme’s templates display.

As noted in [Registering Patterns](#themes/patterns/registering-patterns), there is a single required header field needed for your template pattern (and one optional field):

- **`Template Types`:** One or more template types, separated by comma, that the pattern should be associated with.
- **`Inserter`:** *(Optional)* Often, you will not want template patterns to be available via the inserter. To disable this, set it to `no` or `false`.

Suppose that you created a pattern that would work well for the Front Page or Home templates. Here is what a fictional `/patterns/home-template.php` file would look like:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Home Template
 * Slug: themeslug/home-template
 * Template Types: front-page, home
 * Viewport width: 1376
 * Inserter: no
 */
?>
<!-- Block code here. -->
```

From that point, anytime a user attempted to create a new Front Page or Home template from the WordPress Site Editor, they would be presented with your template pattern as a starting point.

### Supported template types

The following list includes the templates that you can define via the `Template Types` field, but you can always reference the [Template Hierarchy](#themes/templates/template-hierarchy) documentation for a full overview of templates:

- `index`
- `home`
- `front-page`
- `singular`
- `single`
- `page`
- `archive`
- `author`
- `category`
- `taxonomy`
- `date`
- `tag`
- `attachment`
- `search`
- `privacy-policy`
- `404`

### Using template patterns in templates

When creating custom template patterns, it also makes sense to reuse those patterns within your templates. *Why rewrite code?*

Imagine that you created a template pattern that would work as both a Home and Index template. It would look like this:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Index Template
 * Slug: themeslug/index-template
 * Template Types: home, index
 * Viewport width: 1376
 * Inserter: no
 */
?>
<!-- Block code here. -->
```

Now suppose that you included a `/templates/index.html` template in your theme. Instead of adding the code in two places, you can simply call the pattern from the template file:

```markup
<!-- wp:pattern {"slug":"themeslug/index-template"} /-->
```

To learn more about including patterns in templates, check out the [Usage in Templates](#themes/patterns/usage-in-templates) documentation.

# Block Type Patterns <a name="themes/patterns/block-type-patterns" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/patterns/block-type-patterns/

One of the most useful capabilities of patterns is the ability to tie them directly to one or more block types. For example, you can assign a gallery pattern to the Gallery (`core/gallery`) block type and use that specific pattern whenever you insert a new Gallery.

But the feature offers even more than that. In this article, you will learn how to add a basic connection between a block type and a pattern and how to take advantage of some special cases in WordPress.

Besides the techniques described below, block type patterns are also needed for creating starter page patterns, which you can learn more about in the [Starter Patterns](#themes/patterns/starter-patterns) documentation.

## Block-specific patterns

It’s important to note that patterns that are connected to a block type behave just like other patterns. What you’re doing is making WordPress aware that the pattern is meant for one or more block types.

For many cases, you may simply want to create a pattern that serves as a starting point when inserting a specific block, and that’s where block type patterns are often useful.

### Register a block type pattern

As described in [Registering Patterns](#themes/patterns/registering-patterns), you must assign a value to the `Block Types` header field in your pattern file. This field can accept one or more comma-separated block types, which must include the block’s namespace and slug (e.g., `namespace/slug`).

Here is what the file header of pattern tied to the Cover block might look like:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Cover With Contrast Background
 * Slug: themeslug/cover-contrast
 * Categories: banner
 * Block Types: core/cover
 * Viewport Width: 1376
 */
?>
```

### Build a block type pattern

Let’s take what you’ve learned so far and create a pattern for a specific block. In this example, you will create a simple Cover block with a single nested Heading and a background with the `contrast` [color preset](#themes/global-settings-and-styles/settings/color).

Create a new file named `cover-contrast.php` in your theme’s `/patterns` folder and paste this code inside it:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Cover With Contrast Background
 * Slug: themeslug/cover-contrast
 * Categories: banner
 * Block Types: core/cover
 * Viewport Width: 1376
 */
?>
<!-- wp:cover {"overlayColor":"contrast","isUserOverlayColor":true,"align":"full","style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|base"}}}},"textColor":"base","layout":{"type":"constrained"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-cover alignfull has-base-color has-text-color has-link-color">
	<span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-contrast-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim"></span>
	<div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
		<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"center"} -->
			<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><?php esc_html_e( 'A simple heading', 'themeslug' ); ?></h2>
		<!-- /wp:heading -->
	</div>
</div>
<!-- /wp:cover -->
```

Once you’ve saved your pattern file, it should appear as normal in the inserter and Pattern Library. But the most important thing is to check that it’s working as a block type pattern.

Open a new post or page in your WordPress admin and insert a Cover block but don’t make any change to it. Then, click the Cover block’s icon in the toolbar. You should see a **Patterns** menu item, and if you click that, your new pattern will appear:

[![Initial insertion of the Cover block in the block editor. The block's icon is selected in the toolbar and shows a dropdown. In the dropdown, the Patterns sub-menu is selected and shows a transformation option for choosing a pattern.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/cover-pattern-transform.webp?resize=2048%2C1064&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/cover-pattern-transform.webp?ssl=1)From there, if you select the pattern that you’ve registered, it will transform your inserted Cover block inside the content area:

[![WordPress post editor with a Cover block inserted into the content area with a single Heading block nested inside it.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/cover-pattern-replaced.webp?resize=2048%2C1064&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/cover-pattern-replaced.webp?ssl=1)And that is the basics of how block type patterns work. But WordPress has some special handling for some blocks, which you will learn about below.

## Query Loop patterns

The Query Loop block is one of the most unique and useful blocks to create custom patterns for. It gives you and your theme users the ability to quickly insert or replace existing Query blocks with an alternative posts layout.

The technique is the same as other block type patterns. You must add the `core/query` block type to the pattern’s `Block Types` file header field.

Let’s create a basic two-column grid that shows each post’s featured image, title, excerpt and date. You can, of course, use whatever layout and design that you want.

For now, create a new `query-two-columns.php` file in your theme’s `/patterns` folder and paste this code into it:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Query: Two Columns
 * Slug: themeslug/query-two-columns
 * Categories: posts
 * Block Types: core/query
 * Viewport Width: 1376
 */
?>
<!-- wp:query {"query":{"perPage":6,"pages":0,"offset":0,"postType":"post","order":"desc","orderBy":"date","author":"","search":"","exclude":[],"sticky":"","inherit":false},"align":"wide"} -->
<div class="wp-block-query alignwide">
		<!-- wp:post-template {"style":{"spacing":{"blockGap":"var:preset|spacing|40"}},"layout":{"type":"grid","columnCount":2}} -->
		<!-- wp:post-featured-image {"isLink":true,"aspectRatio":"4/3","align":"wide"} /-->
		<!-- wp:post-title {"isLink":true,"fontSize":"large"} /-->
		<!-- wp:post-excerpt {"showMoreOnNewLine":false,"excerptLength":26} /-->
		<!-- wp:post-date /-->
	<!-- /wp:post-template -->
</div>
<!-- /wp:query -->
```

There are two ways to take advantage of Query Loop patterns, like the one you just created. The first is to insert a new Query Loop block into a page or template:

[![Query Loop block inserted into the WordPress block editor with the initial prompt to choose a pattern.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/query-loop-start.webp?resize=2048%2C1064&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/query-loop-start.webp?ssl=1)You should see a couple of buttons for adding a Query Loop from that point. Click the **Choose** button.

This will bring up the **Choose a pattern** modal. In this modal, your pattern will appear and can be selected:

[![Modal overlaying the post editor that shows three options of different patterns for showing a list or grid of posts.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/query-loop-modal.webp?resize=2048%2C1064&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/query-loop-modal.webp?ssl=1)Once selected, your pattern will be inserted into the canvas of the page or template that you are editing:

[![WordPress post editor with a two-column grid of posts shown in the content area.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/query-loop-inserted.webp?resize=2048%2C1064&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/query-loop-inserted.webp?ssl=1)The second method of using Query Loop patterns is much the same. You can replace an existing pattern (even the one you just inserted) by clicking the **Replace** button in the toolbar. It will bring up the same **Choose a pattern** modal, and the process of choosing a pattern is the same.

## Template Part patterns

Because [template parts](#themes/templates/template-parts) are technically blocks themselves, you can also use them as a pattern’s block types. There is one limitation: only parts that use the Header and Footer [template part areas](#themes/templates/template-parts#template-part-areas) are supported. But these are the most common types anyway.

When targeting a specific template part, its block type name will have a third component: the template part area. So if you want to target the Header part, you will pass a block type of `core/template-part/header`. And for the Footer part, use `core/template-part/footer`.

Let’s create a basic Header template part with a centered logo, title, and nav menu. You will use this to replace the existing header on your site.

Create a new file named `header-centered.php` in your theme’s `/patterns` folder. Then copy and paste this code into it:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Header: Centered
 * Slug: themeslug/header-centered
 * Categories: header
 * Block Types: core/template-part/header
 * Viewport Width: 1376
 */
?>
<!-- wp:group {"align":"wide","layout":{"type":"flex","orientation":"vertical","justifyContent":"center"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group alignwide">
	<!-- wp:site-logo {"width":60} /-->
	<!-- wp:site-title {"level":0} /-->
	<!-- wp:navigation {"layout":{"type":"flex","justifyContent":"right","orientation":"horizontal"},"style":{"spacing":{"margin":{"top":"0"},"blockGap":"var:preset|spacing|20"},"layout":{"selfStretch":"fit","flexSize":null}}} /-->
</div>
<!-- /wp:group -->
```

Once you save this file, go to **Appearance &gt; Editor** in your WordPress admin and select the on the Header block.

Now click the **Options** button (**⋮** icon) in the toolbar. You should see a **Replace** option in the dropdown:

[![WordPress Site Editor with the Header Template Part selected in the content area. The Options dropdown shows the "Replace" item highlighted.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/header-part-replace-dropdown.webp?resize=2048%2C1064&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/header-part-replace-dropdown.webp?ssl=1)Once you click the **Replace** dropdown menu item, a new modal titled **Choose a header** will appear, and you should see your **Header: Centered** pattern in the available patterns grid:

[![A modal overlaying the Site Editor screen that reads "Choose a header." Below, it shows a grid of various site header designs to choose from.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/header-pattern-replace.webp?resize=2048%2C1064&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/header-pattern-replace.webp?ssl=1)By selecting this pattern or another, you can replace the entire Header template part. This process works the same for Footer template parts.

Parts for custom [template part areas](#themes/templates/template-parts#template-part-areas) cannot yet take advantage of this feature. There is an [open ticket](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/44689) that has not been patched to handle areas other than Header and Footer.

# Patterns and Block Locking <a name="themes/patterns/patterns-and-block-locking" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/patterns/patterns-and-block-locking/

The [Block Locking API](#block-editor/how-to-guides/curating-the-editor-experience/block-locking) is a powerful set of features that lets you lock the behavior of blocks and how users interact with them. You can control whether users can remove, move, or customize blocks, which lets you further curate the editing experience of your themes.

This article will explore some of the ways that you can utilize the API within your theme’s patterns. But for a deeper dive into the API, please refer to the [Block Locking documentation](#block-editor/how-to-guides/curating-the-editor-experience/block-locking) in the Block Editor Handbook.

You are not only limited to using Block Locking in patterns. You can also apply the methods in this article to [templates](#themes/templates).

## What is Block Locking?

The Block Locking API lets you control how a user interacts with blocks on their site. The types of locking you can do are:

- Disabling block movement in the editor.
- Preventing a block from being removed.
- Preventing new blocks from being inserted.
- Disabling editing block settings other than content and media.

This can be really useful depending on the scenario. For example, it often makes sense to lock a site header pattern, which can be complex, by disabling the deletion of its inner blocks by accident.

There are also two types of locking the API offers: block and template. Locking at the block level means preventing the user from taking some actions for the individual block. Locking at the template level means preventing the user from some actions at a “group” level.

It’s important to note that “template” here refers to a section of blocks nested within a container block, such as Group, Cover, etc. It’s not referring specifically to template files.

## Block locking

In this section, you will learn how to lock individual blocks. Namely, preventing a user from moving a block or removing it altogether.

First, you should familiarize yourself with how to lock blocks from the UI. Let’s start by creating a custom “event” pattern to work for throughout the remainder of this article.

Create a new file in your theme named `/patterns/event.php` and place the following code into it:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Event
 * Slug: themeslug/event
 * Categories: banner
 * Viewport Width: 1376
 */
?>
<!-- wp:group {"align":"wide","style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|base-2"}}},"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"var:preset|spacing|30","bottom":"var:preset|spacing|30","left":"var:preset|spacing|30","right":"var:preset|spacing|30"}}},"backgroundColor":"contrast","textColor":"base-2","layout":{"type":"default"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-base-2-color has-contrast-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30)">

	<!-- wp:image {"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
	<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://s.w.org/patterns/files/2021/06/Group-17-scaled.jpg" alt="Image of a woman being carried through the air by swans."/></figure>
	<!-- /wp:image -->

	<!-- wp:columns {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
	<div class="wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-center">
		
		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:paragraph -->
			<p><strong><?php esc_html_e( 'Location:', 'themeslug' ); ?></strong><br><?php esc_html_e( '82 Main St. Brooklyn, NY', 'themeslug' ); ?></p>
			<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:paragraph -->
			<p><strong><?php esc_html_e( 'Date:', 'themeslug' ); ?></strong><br><?php esc_html_e( 'October 24, 2021', 'themeslug' ); ?></p>
			<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:buttons -->
			<div class="wp-block-buttons">
				<!-- wp:button {"width":100,"className":"is-style-outline"} -->
				<div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-100 is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php esc_html_e( 'Purchase Tickets' ); ?></a></div>
				<!-- /wp:button -->
			</div>
			<!-- /wp:buttons -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

	</div>
	<!-- /wp:columns -->

</div>
<!-- /wp:group -->
```

Then go to the post editor and insert your new pattern. Once you’ve done that, you should see the pattern in the content area.

Now select the Image block (or any block) in the pattern. Then click the **Options** button in the block toolbar. You should see a **Lock** option:

[![WordPress post editor with an event pattern inserted into the content area. The outer Group block is selected and its Options dropdown menu is shown in the toolbar with the "Lock" option highlighted.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/lock-menu.webp?resize=2048%2C1061&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/lock-menu.webp?ssl=1)This will bring up a modal for various locking options, which you’ll learn about in the following sections.

This type of locking is shown in the UI, and a theme user will be able to override it from the UI. For publicly-distributed themes, this is a good thing. But for client work, this type of access may be undesirable. If you need to control permissions to the locking UI, see the instructions in the Locking API docs: [Change permissions to control locking ability](#block-editor/how-to-guides/curating-the-editor-experience/block-locking#change-permissions-to-control-locking-ability).

### Disable block movement

One of the primary use cases of the Block Locking API is to prevent users from accidentally moving blocks around within a pattern, altering the layout. In the **Lock** modal, you will see an option to **Disable movement**. Try selecting this option for the Image block from the event pattern:

[![WordPress post editor with an event pattern inserted into the content area. A "Lock Image" modal overlays the screen with the "Disable movement" option selected.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/lock-modal-disable-movement.webp?resize=2048%2C1061&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/lock-modal-disable-movement.webp?ssl=1)Under the hood, when you select this option, WordPress will add a new `lock` attribute to the block markup that looks like this:

```markup
<!-- wp:image {"lock":{"move":true,"remove":false}} -->
```

Because you’ve selected the **Disable movement** option, the `move` key will have a value of `true` (i.e., movement has been locked).

Now try creating a new version of your pattern with the Image block’s movement disabled. Add a new `/patterns/event-disable-movement.php` file to your theme and paste this code in:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Event (Disable Movement)
 * Slug: themeslug/event-disable-movement
 * Categories: banner
 * Viewport Width: 1376
 */
?>
<!-- wp:group {"align":"wide","style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|base-2"}}},"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"var:preset|spacing|30","bottom":"var:preset|spacing|30","left":"var:preset|spacing|30","right":"var:preset|spacing|30"}}},"backgroundColor":"contrast","textColor":"base-2","layout":{"type":"default"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-base-2-color has-contrast-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30)">

	<!-- wp:image {"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","lock":{"move":true,"remove":false}} -->
	<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://s.w.org/patterns/files/2021/06/Group-17-scaled.jpg" alt="Image of a woman being carried through the air by swans."/></figure>
	<!-- /wp:image -->

	<!-- wp:columns {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
	<div class="wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-center">
		
		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:paragraph -->
			<p><strong><?php esc_html_e( 'Location:', 'themeslug' ); ?></strong><br><?php esc_html_e( '82 Main St. Brooklyn, NY', 'themeslug' ); ?></p>
			<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:paragraph -->
			<p><strong><?php esc_html_e( 'Date:', 'themeslug' ); ?></strong><br><?php esc_html_e( 'October 24, 2021', 'themeslug' ); ?></p>
			<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:buttons -->
			<div class="wp-block-buttons">
				<!-- wp:button {"width":100,"className":"is-style-outline"} -->
				<div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-100 is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php esc_html_e( 'Purchase Tickets' ); ?></a></div>
				<!-- /wp:button -->
			</div>
			<!-- /wp:buttons -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

	</div>
	<!-- /wp:columns -->

</div>
<!-- /wp:group -->
```

Now, anytime a user adds this pattern to their content, they won’t be able to move the Image block within the pattern.

Just because the Image block’s movement has been disabled, it doesn’t affect other blocks within the pattern. For example, it’s still possible to move the Columns block. You would need to disable both blocks from being moved to stop the user from moving either.

### Prevent block removal

For some patterns, you will want to keep a block from being deleted altogether. For example, in the event pattern, the Image block may be integral to the pattern’s design.

Starting from the original event pattern, repeat the process of opening the **Lock** modal. This time, select the **Prevent removal** option:

[![WordPress post editor with an event pattern inserted into the content area. A "Lock Image" modal overlays the screen with the "Prevent removal" option selected.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/lock-modal-prevent-removal.webp?resize=2048%2C1061&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/lock-modal-prevent-removal.webp?ssl=1)Again, WordPress will automatically insert the `lock` attribute in the block markup, which will look like this:

```markup
<!-- wp:image {"lock":{"move":false,"remove":true}} -->
```

This time, the `remove` option is set to `true` (i.e., removal has been locked).

Now create an alternate version of your pattern with the Image block’s removal disabled. Add a new `/patterns/event-prevent-removal.php` file to your theme and paste this code in:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Event (Prevent Removal)
 * Slug: themeslug/event-prevent-removal
 * Categories: banner
 * Viewport Width: 1376
 */
?>
<!-- wp:group {"align":"wide","style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|base-2"}}},"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"var:preset|spacing|30","bottom":"var:preset|spacing|30","left":"var:preset|spacing|30","right":"var:preset|spacing|30"}}},"backgroundColor":"contrast","textColor":"base-2","layout":{"type":"default"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-base-2-color has-contrast-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30)">

	<!-- wp:image {"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","lock":{"move":false,"remove":true}} -->
	<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://s.w.org/patterns/files/2021/06/Group-17-scaled.jpg" alt="Image of a woman being carried through the air by swans."/></figure>
	<!-- /wp:image -->

	<!-- wp:columns {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
	<div class="wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-center">
		
		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:paragraph -->
			<p><strong><?php esc_html_e( 'Location:', 'themeslug' ); ?></strong><br><?php esc_html_e( '82 Main St. Brooklyn, NY', 'themeslug' ); ?></p>
			<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:paragraph -->
			<p><strong><?php esc_html_e( 'Date:', 'themeslug' ); ?></strong><br><?php esc_html_e( 'October 24, 2021', 'themeslug' ); ?></p>
			<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:buttons -->
			<div class="wp-block-buttons">
				<!-- wp:button {"width":100,"className":"is-style-outline"} -->
				<div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-100 is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php esc_html_e( 'Purchase Tickets' ); ?></a></div>
				<!-- /wp:button -->
			</div>
			<!-- /wp:buttons -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

	</div>
	<!-- /wp:columns -->

</div>
<!-- /wp:group -->
```

Now, whenever a user inserts this pattern, they will not be able to remove the Image block. They’ll still be able to edit the image itself and any settings, though.

You can combine both of these techniques, locking movement and removal, depending on your use case. For some patterns, this is often needed to keep the design of the pattern intact.

## Template locking

Template locking refers to locking all of the nested blocks within a container-type block. There are three types of locking that you can accomplish with template locking:

- **`all`:** Combined with the block locking methods covered earlier, lock all blocks within the container.
- **`insert`:** Prevent users from inserting new blocks within the container.
- **`contentOnly`:** Lock down all block settings within the container, only allowing the user to edit content (e.g., text and media).

Template locking is only possible for a subset of container-type blocks in Core:

- Group
- Cover
- Columns
- Column
- Navigation

### Locking all nested blocks

With the built-in UI controls, you can lock all nested blocks within a pattern if it’s wrapped in one of the supported container-type blocks.

This type of locking builds off the block locking covered earlier in this article. You can choose to disable movement, prevent removal, or both for all nested blocks.

When clicking on the wrapping Group block inside your event pattern and opening the **Lock** modal, select both the **Disable movement** and **Prevent removal** options. You should also see another option labeled **Apply to all blocks**, which will let you apply these rules to every block inside the Group:

[![WordPress post editor with an event pattern inserted into the content area. A "Lock Group" modal overlays the screen with all locking options selected and applied to nested blocks.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/lock-modal.webp?resize=2048%2C1061&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/lock-modal.webp?ssl=1)If you look at the underlying block markup, you will see a new `templateLock` attribute, which will be set to `all`. You will also see the `lock` attribute with both `move` and `remove` set to `true`:

```markup
<!-- wp:group {"templateLock":"all","lock":{"move":true,"remove":true}} -->
```

Like with individual block locking, you can mix and match what you want to lock at the template level.

Now create a new file named `/patterns/event-lock-all.php` in your theme and paste the following code into it:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Event (Lock All)
 * Slug: themeslug/event-lock-all
 * Categories: banner
 * Viewport Width: 1376
 */
?>
<!-- wp:group {"templateLock":"all","lock":{"move":true,"remove":true},"align":"wide","style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|base-2"}}},"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"var:preset|spacing|30","bottom":"var:preset|spacing|30","left":"var:preset|spacing|30","right":"var:preset|spacing|30"}}},"backgroundColor":"contrast","textColor":"base-2","layout":{"type":"default"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-base-2-color has-contrast-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30)">

	<!-- wp:image {"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
	<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://s.w.org/patterns/files/2021/06/Group-17-scaled.jpg" alt="Image of a woman being carried through the air by swans."/></figure>
	<!-- /wp:image -->

	<!-- wp:columns {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
	<div class="wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-center">
		
		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:paragraph -->
			<p><strong><?php esc_html_e( 'Location:', 'themeslug' ); ?></strong><br><?php esc_html_e( '82 Main St. Brooklyn, NY', 'themeslug' ); ?></p>
			<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:paragraph -->
			<p><strong><?php esc_html_e( 'Date:', 'themeslug' ); ?></strong><br><?php esc_html_e( 'October 24, 2021', 'themeslug' ); ?></p>
			<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:buttons -->
			<div class="wp-block-buttons">
				<!-- wp:button {"width":100,"className":"is-style-outline"} -->
				<div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-100 is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php esc_html_e( 'Purchase Tickets' ); ?></a></div>
				<!-- /wp:button -->
			</div>
			<!-- /wp:buttons -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

	</div>
	<!-- /wp:columns -->

</div>
<!-- /wp:group -->
```

Whenever a user inserts this new pattern into their content, they will not be able to move or remove any of the blocks within the pattern. But they can still edit each block’s content and settings.

### Preventing new blocks from being inserted

You can also lock your container-type blocks in patterns from having new blocks inserted into them. This is useful when you need to keep tight control over what is allowed within the design.

Unlock previous methods of locking blocks, this method has no UI controls associated with it. This means that you must edit the block markup directly by adding the `templateLock` value.

Take a look at what this looks like when applied to a wrapping Group block:

```markup
<!-- wp:group {"templateLock":"insert"} -->
```

As you can see, the `templateLock` attribute is set to `insert` (i.e, the Group has locked inserting new blocks).

Now create a new file in your theme named `/patterns/event-prevent-insert.php` and paste the following code into it:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Event (Prevent Insert)
 * Slug: themeslug/event-prevent-insert
 * Categories: banner
 * Viewport Width: 1376
 */
?>
<!-- wp:group {"templateLock":"insert","align":"wide","style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|base-2"}}},"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"var:preset|spacing|30","bottom":"var:preset|spacing|30","left":"var:preset|spacing|30","right":"var:preset|spacing|30"}}},"backgroundColor":"contrast","textColor":"base-2","layout":{"type":"default"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-base-2-color has-contrast-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30)">

	<!-- wp:image {"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
	<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://s.w.org/patterns/files/2021/06/Group-17-scaled.jpg" alt="Image of a woman being carried through the air by swans."/></figure>
	<!-- /wp:image -->

	<!-- wp:columns {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
	<div class="wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-center">
		
		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:paragraph -->
			<p><strong><?php esc_html_e( 'Location:', 'themeslug' ); ?></strong><br><?php esc_html_e( '82 Main St. Brooklyn, NY', 'themeslug' ); ?></p>
			<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:paragraph -->
			<p><strong><?php esc_html_e( 'Date:', 'themeslug' ); ?></strong><br><?php esc_html_e( 'October 24, 2021', 'themeslug' ); ?></p>
			<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:buttons -->
			<div class="wp-block-buttons">
				<!-- wp:button {"width":100,"className":"is-style-outline"} -->
				<div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-100 is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php esc_html_e( 'Purchase Tickets' ); ?></a></div>
				<!-- /wp:button -->
			</div>
			<!-- /wp:buttons -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

	</div>
	<!-- /wp:columns -->

</div>
<!-- /wp:group -->
```

When a user adds this pattern into their post or page content, they will be able to customize the blocks within the pattern. But they will not be able to add any new blocks from within the UI.

### Applying content-only editing

One of the most useful features for patterns is to use template locking to only allow the user to customize the content of a pattern. This can be useful when you need full control over the design but need to allow user input.

When this type of locking is applied to a container-type block, users will see a new **Content** panel when inspecting any block instead of the usual block settings:

[![WordPress post editor with an event pattern shown. The outer Group block is selected. In the sidebar, instead of the normal design and setting controls, it has a "Content" panel that shows the nested blocks.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/pattern-locking-content-only.webp?resize=2048%2C1061&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2024/04/pattern-locking-content-only.webp?ssl=1)This is also a type of locking that has no UI controls and must be manually applied to the block markup. If applied to the outer Group block of your pattern, it will look like this:

```markup
<!-- wp:group {"templateLock":"contentOnly"} -->
```

Note that the `templateLock` attribute is set to `contentOnly`, which means that everything but content editing is locked.

Now let’s apply this to the event pattern. Create a new file in your theme named `/patterns/event-content-only.php` and paste the following code into it:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Event (Content Only)
 * Slug: themeslug/event-content-only
 * Categories: banner
 * Viewport Width: 1376
 */
?>
<!-- wp:group {"templateLock":"contentOnly","align":"wide","style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|base-2"}}},"spacing":{"padding":{"top":"var:preset|spacing|30","bottom":"var:preset|spacing|30","left":"var:preset|spacing|30","right":"var:preset|spacing|30"}}},"backgroundColor":"contrast","textColor":"base-2","layout":{"type":"default"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group alignwide has-base-2-color has-contrast-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30)">

	<!-- wp:image {"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
	<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://s.w.org/patterns/files/2021/06/Group-17-scaled.jpg" alt="Image of a woman being carried through the air by swans."/></figure>
	<!-- /wp:image -->

	<!-- wp:columns {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
	<div class="wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-center">
		
		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:paragraph -->
			<p><strong><?php esc_html_e( 'Location:', 'themeslug' ); ?></strong><br><?php esc_html_e( '82 Main St. Brooklyn, NY', 'themeslug' ); ?></p>
			<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:paragraph -->
			<p><strong><?php esc_html_e( 'Date:', 'themeslug' ); ?></strong><br><?php esc_html_e( 'October 24, 2021', 'themeslug' ); ?></p>
			<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

		<!-- wp:column {"verticalAlignment":"center"} -->
		<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center">
			<!-- wp:buttons -->
			<div class="wp-block-buttons">
				<!-- wp:button {"width":100,"className":"is-style-outline"} -->
				<div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-100 is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button"><?php esc_html_e( 'Purchase Tickets' ); ?></a></div>
				<!-- /wp:button -->
			</div>
			<!-- /wp:buttons -->
		</div>
		<!-- /wp:column -->

	</div>
	<!-- /wp:columns -->

</div>
<!-- /wp:group -->
```

With this setting in place, the user will be able to edit the Image block’s media and the content of the individual Paragraph and Button blocks. But they won’t be able to make any design changes directly inside of the pattern.

# Post Template Files <a name="themes/template-files-section/post-template-files" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/post-template-files/

There are many [template files](#themes/basics/template-files) that WordPress uses to display the Post [post type](#themes/basics/post-types). Any content dealing with a blog or its posts are within the Post post type.

## Index.php

`index.php` will display Post post types if there is no other template file in place. As stated in many places, every theme must have an `index.php` file to be valid. Many basic themes can get away with just using the `index.php` to display their Post post types, but the use cases given above would justify creating other template files.

Often you will want unique content structure or layout depending on what is being displayed. There are many templates you can use to customize content structure based on the context within the site. The two most notable post template files are `home.php` and `single.php` which display a feed of posts and a single post respectively.

## Home.php

When a static front page is used and the site has a page defined for the blog list the `home.php` file is used for the designated blog list page. Use of this template is encouraged over creating a custom page template because blog pagination on a custom page template will not work properly. If there is no `home.php` in the theme `index.php` will be used instead.

## Single.php

It’s good sense to build as simply as possible in your template structure and not make more templates unless you have real need for them. Therefore, most theme developers don’t create a single-post.php file because single.php is specific enough. For the most part, all themes should have a `single.php`. Below is an example of a `single.php` file from the theme Twenty Fifteen.

```php
<?php
/**
 * The template for displaying all single posts and attachments
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage Twenty_Fifteen
 * @since Twenty Fifteen 1.0
 */
 
get_header(); ?>
 
    <div id="primary" class="content-area">
        <main id="main" class="site-main" role="main">
 
        <?php
        // Start the loop.
        while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();
 
            /*
             * Include the post format-specific template for the content. If you want to
             * use this in a child theme, then include a file called called content-___.php
             * (where ___ is the post format) and that will be used instead.
             */
            get_template_part( 'content', get_post_format() );
 
            // If comments are open or we have at least one comment, load up the comment template.
            if ( comments_open() || get_comments_number() ) :
                comments_template();
            endif;
 
            // Previous/next post navigation.
            the_post_navigation( array(
                'next_text' => '<span class="meta-nav" aria-hidden="true">' . __( 'Next', 'twentyfifteen' ) . '</span> ' .
                    '<span class="screen-reader-text">' . __( 'Next post:', 'twentyfifteen' ) . '</span> ' .
                    '<span class="post-title">%title</span>',
                'prev_text' => '<span class="meta-nav" aria-hidden="true">' . __( 'Previous', 'twentyfifteen' ) . '</span> ' .
                    '<span class="screen-reader-text">' . __( 'Previous post:', 'twentyfifteen' ) . '</span> ' .
                    '<span class="post-title">%title</span>',
            ) );
 
        // End the loop.
        endwhile;
        ?>
 
        </main><!-- .site-main -->
    </div><!-- .content-area -->
 
<?php get_footer(); ?>
```

In the code example above you can see the header is pulled in with `<a href="#reference/functions/get_header">get_header()</a>` then there are a two html tags. Next [the Loop](#themes/basics/the-loop) starts and the [template tag](#themes/basics/template-tags) `<a href="#reference/functions/get_template_part">get_template_part</a>( ``'content'``, get_post_format());` pulls in the appropriate content by determining the post type with `<a href="#reference/functions/get_post_format">get_post_format()</a>`. Next, [comments](#themes/functionality/comments) are pulled in with the template tag [comments\_template()](#reference/functions/comments_template). Then there is some [pagination](#themes/functionality/pagination). Lastly, the content divs are closed and then footer is pulled in with `<a href="#reference/functions/get_footer">get_footer()</a>`.

## Singular.php

WordPress Version 4.3 added `singular.php` that comes in the hierarchy after `single.php` for posts, `page.php` for pages, and the variations of each. This template follows the rules of [is\_singular()](#reference/functions/is_singular) and is used for a single post, regardless of post type. Themes that used the same code for both of those files (or included one in the other) can now simplify down to the one template.

## Archive.php

Unless a developer includes meta data with permalinks in their templates, the `archive.php` will not be used. Meta data is information tied to the post. For example the date something was posted on, the author, and any [categories, tags, or taxonomies](#themes/functionality/categories-tags-custom-taxonomies) used for the post are all examples of meta data. When a visitor to a website clicks on the meta data, the `archive.php` will render any posts associated with that piece of meta data. For example, if a visitor clicks on the name of an author, the `archive.php` will display all posts by that author.

Commonly, the title of the page being displayed by `archive.php` will be the name of the meta data the user clicked on. So if the user clicked on the Author’s name, the page name displaying all the other author’s posts will be the Author’s name and frequently there might be an additional description about the meta data. Here is a code example from Twenty Fifteen on their `archive.php` file. This snippet is the only piece of code that makes the `archive.php` file different from a `home.php` or `index.php` file.

```php
<header class="page-header">
    <?php
        the_archive_title( '<h1 class="page-title">', '</h1>' );
        the_archive_description( '<div class="taxonomy-description">', '</div>' );
    ?>
</header>
<!-- .page-header -->
```

## Author.php and Date.php

`Author.php` and `date.php` are more specific archive type files. If you need a refresher check out where they fit within the [template heirarchy](#themes/basics/template-hierarchy). Generally, `archive.php` will suffice for most themes’ needs and you won’t need to create these templates.

### Author.php

If you are building a theme designed for multiple authors, it might make sense to build an author.php template. In the `author.php` template you could provide more information about an author, their gravatar, pull in their social media sites, and then all posts written by them. This would be a step up from relying just on the `archive.php` file.

Additionally, you can build specific `author.php` files for individual author’s by using their author ID or nicename. For example, say John Doe is the head author for a site with many guest authors. You may want all the guest authors’ information to display with author.php but you might build a specific author page with more information for John Doe by creating `author-johndoe.php` or `author-3.php` if his author ID is 3.

### Date.php

Similarly, if you are building a theme directed at magazine or news websites, a `date.php` file might make sense to build as these websites frequently organize their articles and posts by date or issue. Additionally, you could build a `day.php`, `month.php`, or `year.php` if you found enough justification for it.

## Category.php, Tag.php, and Taxonomy.php

If you need a refresher on what [categories, tags, &amp; taxonomies](#themes/basics/categories-tags-custom-taxonomies) are you can look at their page. Often you won’t need to build out these template files. However, in an example of building a theme for food bloggers, there are some use cases for building these specific templates. In a food blogger website, the categories could be Great Restaurants, Beautiful Food, Ethnic Cuisine, and Recipes.

You might want most of your blog posts to display the same way except for any blogs that are categorized as recipes, because all recipes have ingredients and instrucitons sections. Therefore, you may want to build a `category-recipe.php` file to display your recipe blog posts in a grid view with some of the important details about the recipe visible.

Additionally, perhaps chocolate is a really important tag for the theme you’re building. It might make sense to build a `tag-chocolate.php` file so that you can display a specialized banner image of chocolate.

## Search.php

Most themes have a search.php file so it is clear to users that their query went through. It is common to have some sort of header identifying the query results such as this snippet found int twenty fifteen’s theme.

```php
<header class="page-header">
<h1 class="page-title">
    <?php printf( __( 'Search Results for: %s', 'twentyfifteen' ), get_search_query() ); ?>
</h1>
</header><!-- .page-header -->
```

This code snippet pulls in the query that was searched with `get_search_query()`. Often `search.php` will only pull in the excerpt instead of the full content since the user is trying to determine if the article or page fits their search.

# Template Files Section <a name="themes/template-files-section" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/

We introduced [template files](#themes/basics/template-files) earlier in the handbook. This next section is going to break up the different template files through the [post types](#themes/basics/post-types) that they display and provide a more in depth explanation of the purpose for these template files. You’ll also get a handle on some practical use cases for the different template files.

You’ll start with [post template files](#themes/template-files-section/post-template-files) that deal with displaying the Post post type. Then you’ll look at [page template files](#themes/template-files-section/page-template-files) that display the Page post type and drill down into [specific page templates](#themes/template-files-section/page-template-filespage-templates/) that WordPress has built in to its functionality. Next you’ll learn about [attachment template files](#themes/template-files-section/attachment-template-files) which display the attachment post type. You’ll also learn about how to display custom post types that are built by a plugin in the [custom post type templates](#themes/template-files-section/custom-post-type-template-files). Lastly, you’ll touch on some [partial and miscellaneous template files](#themes/template-files-section/partial-and-miscellaneous-template-files) which are important to include but don’t necessarily display post types.

 It’s important to understand WordPress doesn’t really break down template files down into specific types of template files such as post template files or attachment template files. Especially since many template files, such as `index.php` or `search.php` can display many different post types. To help you reference specific template files this handbook is categorizing them based on the post types they can display.

# Attachment Template Files <a name="themes/template-files-section/attachment-template-files" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/attachment-template-files/

Attachments are a special post type that holds information about a file uploaded through the WordPress media upload system, such as its description and name, which can display through several **post type – attachment** template files.

For images, as an example, the attachment post type links to metadata information, about the size of the images, the thumbnails generated, the location of the image files, the HTML alt text, and even information obtained from EXIF data embedded in the images.

Utilizing attachment templates to gain additional metadata information for uploads, help with SEO efforts. 

As shown in the [template hierarchy](#themes/basics/template-hierarchy), you are able to display your attachments through several template files in order of fallback:

1. `MIME_type.php` and a `subtype.php`  
    It can be any MIME type (For example: `image.php`, `video.php`, `application.php`). For text/plain, the following path is used (in order): 
    1. `text_plain.php`
    2. `plain.php`
    3. `text.php`
2. `attachment.php`
3. `single-attachment.php`
4. `single.php`
5. `singular.php`
6. `index.php`

## MIME\_type.php

Attachments are served by template files based on their mime-type. As an example, if your attachment is an image, your can customize how they display through the creation of an `image.php` template file. All images with the `post_mime_type` of image/\* will render though your `image.php` template file.

Attachments also support the use of a mime `subtype.php` file. To continue with the image example, you can further customize your theme to support not only an `image.php` file but a `jpg.php` subtype file.

## Attachment.php

An attachment page (`attachment.php`) is a single post page with the post type of attachment, generated through the creation of an attachment.php. Just like a [single post page](#themes/template-files-section/post-template-files), which is dedicated to your article, the attachment page provides a dedicated page in attachments in your theme.

Creation of attachment page is as simple as creating an attachment.php file. The attachment.php file then contains code similar to the single.php post page.

```php
<div class="entry-attachment">
	<?php
	$image_size = apply_filters( 'wporg_attachment_size', 'large' );
	echo wp_get_attachment_image( get_the_ID(), $image_size );
	?>

	<?php if ( has_excerpt() ) : ?>
		<div class="entry-caption">
			<?php the_excerpt(); ?>
		</div><!-- .entry-caption -->
	<?php endif; ?>
</div><!-- .entry-attachment -->
```

## Function Reference

- [get\_attachment\_template()](#reference/functions/get_attachment_template) : Retrieve path of attachment template in current or parent template.

# Custom Post Type Template Files <a name="themes/template-files-section/custom-post-type-template-files" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/custom-post-type-template-files/

The WordPress theme system supports custom [templates](#themes/basics/template-files) for custom post types. Custom templates for the single display of posts belonging to custom post types have been supported since WordPress [Version 3.0](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0) and the support for custom templates for archive displays was added in [Version 3.1](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.1).

## Custom Post Type – Template Hierarchy

WordPress will work through the [template hierarchy](#themes/basics/template-hierarchy) and use the template file it comes across first. So if you want to create a custom template for your `acme_product` custom post type, a good place to start is by copying the `single.php` file, saving it as `single-acme_product.php` and editing that.

However if you don’t want to create custom template files, WordPress will use the files already present in your theme, which would be `archive.php` and `single.php` and `index.php` files.

Single posts and their archives can be displayed using the `single.php` and `archive.php` template files respectively,

- single posts of a custom post type will use **single-{post\_type}.php**
- and their archives will use **archive-{post\_type}.php**
- and if you don’t have this post type archive page you can pass **BLOG\_URL?post\_type={post\_type}**

where `{post_type}` is the `$post_type` argument of the [register\_post\_type()](#reference/functions/register_post_type) function.

So for the above example, you could create `single-acme_product.php` and `archive-acme_product.php` template files for single product posts and their archives.

Alternatively, you can use the `is_post_type_archive()` function in any template file to check if the query shows an archive page of a given post types(s), and the `post_type_archive_title()` to display the post type title.

## Custom Post Type templates

- **single-{post-type}.php**  
    The single post template used when a visitor requests a single post from a custom post type. For example, `single-acme_product.php` would be used for displaying single posts from a custom post type named `acme_product`.
- **archive-{post-type}.php**  
    The archive post type template is used when visitors request a custom post type archive. For example, `archive-acme_product.php` would be used for displaying an archive of posts from the custom post type named `acme_product`. The `archive.php` template file is used if the `archive-{post-type}.php` is not present.
- **index.php**  
    The `index.php` is used if a specific query template (`single-{post-type}.php, single.php, archive-{post-type}.php, archive.php, search.php`) for the custom post type is not present.

## Function Reference

- [register\_post\_type()](#reference/functions/register_post_type) : Registers a post type.
- [is\_post\_type\_archive()](#reference/functions/is_post_type_archive) : Checks if the query for an existing post type archive page.
- [post\_type\_archive\_title()](#reference/functions/post_type_archive_title) : Display or retrieve title for a post type archive.

# Partial and Miscellaneous Template Files <a name="themes/template-files-section/partial-and-miscellaneous-template-files" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/partial-and-miscellaneous-template-files/

## Introduction

Not all template files generate the entire content that will be rendered by the browser. Some template files are pulled in by other template files such as `comments.php`, `header.php`, `footer.php`, `sidebar.php` and `content-{$slug}.php`. You’ll walk through each of these template files to get an understanding of the purpose and how to build them.

## Header.php

The `header.php` file does exactly what you would expect. It contains all the code that the browser will render for the header. This is a partial template file because unless a different template file calls the [template tag](#themes/basics/template-tags), `get_header()`, the browser will not render the contents of this file.

Often sites have the same header regardless of the page or post you’re on. However, some sites have slight variations such as a secondary navigation or different banner image depending on the page. Your `header.php` file can handle all these variations if you use [conditional tags](#themes/basics/conditional-tags).

Almost all themes have a `header.php` file as the functionality and maintainability of this file pretty much demands its creation.

Below is an example of a header.php found in the twenty fifteen theme.

```php

<html <?php language_attributes(); ?> class="no-js">
<head>
    <meta charset="<?php bloginfo( 'charset' ); ?>">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <link rel="profile" href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/11">
    <link rel="pingback" href="<?php bloginfo( 'pingback_url' ); ?>">
    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script src="<?php echo esc_url( get_template_directory_uri() ); ?>/js/html5.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->
    <?php wp_head(); ?>
</head>
 
<body <?php body_class(); ?>>
    <div id="page" class="hfeed site">
        <a class="skip-link screen-reader-text" href="#content"><?php _e( 'Skip to content', 'twentyfifteen' ); ?></a>
        <div id="sidebar" class="sidebar">
            <header id="masthead" class="site-header" role="banner">
                <div class="site-branding">
                    <?php if ( is_front_page() && is_home() ) : ?>
                    <h1 class="site-title">
                        <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>" rel="home"><?php bloginfo( 'name' ); ?></a>
                    </h1>
                    <?php else : ?>
                    <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>" rel="home"><?php bloginfo( 'name' ); ?></a>
                    <?php endif;
                    $description = get_bloginfo( 'description', 'display' );
                    if ( $description || is_customize_preview() ) :
                        echo $description;
                    endif; ?>
                    <button class="secondary-toggle"><?php _e( 'Menu and widgets', 'twentyfifteen' ); ?></button>
                </div><!-- .site-branding -->
            </header><!-- .site-header -->
            <?php get_sidebar(); ?>
        </div><!-- .sidebar -->
        <div id="content" class="site-content">
```

Some of the code may look a little daunting at first, but if we break it down, it becomes simple enough. After the opening commment, the `head` is created. The template tag `wp_head()` pulls in all of our styles and any scripts that would appear in the head rather than the footer that we enqueued in our `functions.php` file.

Next, the `body` is opened and a mix of HTML and PHP are present. You can see some conditional tags in the site branding div that tweak a little bit of what is shown based on the page the user is on. Then the site navigation is pulled in. Lastly, the main site-content div is opened which will be closed most likely in the `footer.php` file.

One important template tag to note is `body_class()` found in the opening `body` tag. This is a super handy tag that makes styling your theme a lot easier by giving your body classes depending on the template file and other settings being used.

## Footer.php

Much like the `header.php` file the `footer.php` is a very common template file that most themes utilize. The code in the `footer.php` file will not be rendered unless another template file pulls in the `footer.php` with `get_footer()` [template tag](#themes/basics/template-tags). Similarly to headers, you can make variations of footers using [conditional tags](#themes/basics/conditional-tags).

Often developers will put [widgetized areas](#themes/functionality/widgets) in the footer so that the end user can easily drop and drag different content types into the footer.

Here is an example of a `footer.php` file from the Twenty Fifteen theme.

```php
</div><!-- .site-content -->

<footer id="colophon" class="site-footer" role="contentinfo">

	<div class="site-info">

		<?php
		/**
		 * Fires before the Twenty Fifteen footer text for footer customization.
		 *
		 * @since Twenty Fifteen 1.0
		 */
		do_action( 'twentyfifteen_credits' );
		?>
		<a href="<?php echo esc_url( __( 'https://wordpress.org/', 'twentyfifteen' ) ); ?>"><?php printf( __( 'Proudly powered by %s', 'twentyfifteen' ), 'WordPress' ); ?></a>

	</div><!-- .site-info -->

</footer><!-- .site-footer -->

</div><!-- .site -->

<?php wp_footer(); ?>

</body>
</html>
```

## 404.php

When users try to visit a page on your website that doesn’t exist they’ll be directed to your `index.php` page unless you’ve created a 404.php template. It’s a good idea to have some sort of message that the explains the page is missing or no longer available. Creating this template helps keep the visual aspects of your theme consistent and provides your end users with helpful information.

Here is an example of a 404.php template file from the twenty fifteen theme.

```php
<?php get_header(); ?>

<div id="primary" class="content-area">

	<main id="main" class="site-main" role="main">

		<section class="error-404 not-found">

			<header class="page-header">
				<h1 class="page-title"><?php _e( 'Oops! That page can’t be found.', 'twentyfifteen' ); ?></h1>
			</header><!-- .page-header -->

			<div class="page-content">
				<?php _e( 'It looks like nothing was found at this location. Maybe try a search?', 'twentyfifteen' ); ?>
				<?php get_search_form(); ?>
			</div><!-- .page-content -->

		</section><!-- .error-404 -->

	</main><!-- .site-main -->

</div><!-- .content-area -->

<?php get_footer(); ?>

```

## Comments.php

The `comments.php` file handles exactly what you would expect, comments. This is a partial template that is pulled into other template files to display comments that users leave on a page or post. Several different pages and posts show comments so it makes sense to have one file that can be pulled in when needed.

The code involved in creating comments is expanded upon on the [comment template page](#themes/template-files-section/partial-and-miscellaneous-template-files/comments).

## Sidebar.php

A lot of themes utilize sidebars to display widgets. For a sidebar to work in a theme it must be registered and then a template file for the sidebar must be created. You’ll learn more about [registering sidebars](#themes/functionality/sidebars) in a later chapter. Sidebar files often have conditional statements and the `is_active_sidebar( 'sidebar-name' )` function in them to ensure a widget is in use within the sidebar so that empty HTML isn’t added to a page unnecessarily.

Here is an example of a sidebar template file from the twenty fifteen theme. Notice at the bottom the sidebar is pulled in using `<?php dynamic_sidebar( 'sidebar-1' ); >`. Now whatever, widgets are put into that sidebar will display on the page that is using this pulling in this template.

```php
<?php if ( has_nav_menu( 'primary' ) || has_nav_menu( 'social' ) || is_active_sidebar( 'sidebar-1' ) ) : ?>

	<div id="secondary" class="secondary">

		<?php if ( is_active_sidebar( 'sidebar-1' ) ) : ?>
			<div id="widget-area" class="widget-area" role="complementary">
				<?php dynamic_sidebar( 'sidebar-1' ); ?>
			</div><!-- .widget-area -->
		<?php endif; ?>

	</div><!-- .secondary -->

<?php endif; ?>
```

## Content-{$slug}.php

Many theme developers break their template files into small bite sized pieces. They’ll often put wrappers and page architecture elements in template files like `page.php, home.php, comments.php` etc but then they put the code displaying the content of those pages in another template file. Enter `content-{$slug}.php`: common examples would be `content-page.php, content-post.php, content-portfolio.php, content-none.php`. These are not file names that WordPress recognizes and will interpret a certain way, rather they are a common approach to display specific types of content.

For example, often on blog posts you want to display the author’s name, the date of the post, and possibly the category of the post. You’d also likely have links to previous and next posts. That information wouldn’t be appropriate on a regular page. Similarly on a portfolio page you would likely have a featured image or gallery you would want to display in a way differently than say a blog post’s or page’s featured images.

You’ll want to use the `get_template_part()` [template tag](#themes/basics/template-tags) to pull in the `content-{$slug}.php` file. To pull in your `content-page.php` file you would call `get_template_part( 'content', 'page' );`

Here is twenty fifteen’s example of a `content-page.php` template file.

```php
<article id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>" <?php post_class(); ?>>

	<header class="entry-header">
		<?php the_title( '<h1 class="entry-title">', '</h1>' ); ?>
	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	<div class="entry-content">
		<?php the_content(); ?>
		<?php
		wp_link_pages( array(
			'before'      => '<div class="page-links"><span class="page-links-title">' . __( 'Pages:', 'twentyfifteen' ) . '</span>',
			'after'       => '</div>',
			'link_before' => '<span>',
			'link_after'  => '</span>',
			'pagelink'    => '<span class="screen-reader-text">' . __( 'Page', 'twentyfifteen' ) . ' </span>%',
			'separator'   => '<span class="screen-reader-text">, </span>',
		) );
		?>
	</div><!-- .entry-content -->

	<?php edit_post_link( __( 'Edit', 'twentyfifteen' ), '<footer class="entry-footer"><span class="edit-link">', '</span></footer><!-- .entry-footer -->' ); ?>

</article><!-- #post-## -->
```

# Custom Logo <a name="themes/functionality/custom-logo" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/custom-logo/

## What is a Custom Logo?

Using a custom logo allows site owners to upload an image for their website, which can be placed at the top of their website. It can be uploaded from **Appearance &gt; Header**, in your admin panel. The custom logo support should be added first to your theme using `add_theme_support()`, and then be called in your theme using `the_custom_logo()`. A custom logo is **optional**, but theme authors should use this function if they include a logo to their theme.

### Adding Custom Logo support to your Theme

To enable the use of a custom logo in your theme, add the following to your `functions.php` file:

```php
add_theme_support( 'custom-logo' );
```

When enabling custom logo support, you can configure five parameters by passing along arguments to the `add_theme_support()` function using an array:

```php
function themename_custom_logo_setup() {
	$defaults = array(
		'height'               => 100,
		'width'                => 400,
		'flex-height'          => true,
		'flex-width'           => true,
		'header-text'          => array( 'site-title', 'site-description' ),
		'unlink-homepage-logo' => true, 
	);
	add_theme_support( 'custom-logo', $defaults );
}
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'themename_custom_logo_setup' );
```

The [after\_setup\_theme](#reference/hooks/after_setup_theme) hook is used so that the custom logo support is registered after the theme has loaded.

- `height`  
    Expected logo height in pixels. A custom logo can also use built-in image sizes, such as `thumbnail`, or register a custom size using [`add_image_size()`](#reference/functions/add_image_size).
- `width<br></br> `Expected logo width in pixels. A custom logo can also use built-in image sizes, such as `thumbnail`, or register a custom size using [`add_image_size()`](#reference/functions/add_image_size).
- `flex-height`  
    Whether to allow for a flexible height.
- `flex-width<br></br> `Whether to allow for a flexible width.
- `header-text<br></br> `Classes(s) of elements to hide. It can pass an array of class names here for all elements constituting header text that could be replaced by a logo.
- `unlink-homepage-logo`   
    *If the `<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/28/themes-changes-related-to-get_custom_logo-in-wordpress-5-5/">unlink-homepage-logo</a>` parameter is set to true,* logo images inserted using `get_custom_logo()` or `the_custom_logo()` will no longer link to the homepage when visitors are on that page. In an effort to maintain the styling given to the linked image, the unlinked logo image is inside a `span` tag with the same “custom-logo-link” class.

### Displaying the custom logo in your theme

A custom logo can be displayed in the theme using `the_`custom_logo()`` function. But it’s recommended to wrap the code in a `function_exists()` call to maintain backward compatibility with the older versions of WordPress, like this:

```php
if ( function_exists( 'the_custom_logo' ) ) {
	the_custom_logo();
}
```

Generally logos are added to the `header.php` file of the theme, but it can be elsewhere as well.

If you want to get your current logo URL (or use your own markup) instead of the default markup, you can use the following code:

```php
$custom_logo_id = get_theme_mod( 'custom_logo' );
$logo = wp_get_attachment_image_src( $custom_logo_id , 'full' );
if ( has_custom_logo() ) {
	echo '<img src="' . esc_url( $logo[0] ) . '" alt="' . get_bloginfo( 'name' ) . '">';
} else {
	echo '<h1>' . get_bloginfo('name') . '</h1>';
}
```

### Custom logo template tags

To manage displaying a custom logo in the front-end, these three template tags can be used:

# Main Stylesheet (style.css) <a name="themes/basics/main-stylesheet-style-css" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/main-stylesheet-style-css/

The style.css is a stylesheet (CSS) file required for every WordPress theme. It controls the presentation (visual design and layout) of the website pages.

## Location

In order for WordPress to recognize the set of theme template files as a valid theme, the style.css file needs to be located in the root directory of your theme, not a subdirectory.

For more detailed explanation on how to include the style.css file in a theme, see the “Stylesheets” section of [Enqueuing Scripts and Styles](#themes/basics/including-css-javascript).

## Basic Structure

WordPress uses the header comment section of a style.css to display information about the theme in the Appearance (Themes) dashboard panel.

### Example

Here is an example of the header part of style.css.

```css
/*
Theme Name: Twenty Twenty
Theme URI: https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwenty/
Author: the WordPress team
Author URI: https://wordpress.org/
Description: Our default theme for 2020 is designed to take full advantage of the flexibility of the block editor. Organizations and businesses have the ability to create dynamic landing pages with endless layouts using the group and column blocks. The centered content column and fine-tuned typography also makes it perfect for traditional blogs. Complete editor styles give you a good idea of what your content will look like, even before you publish. You can give your site a personal touch by changing the background colors and the accent color in the Customizer. The colors of all elements on your site are automatically calculated based on the colors you pick, ensuring a high, accessible color contrast for your visitors.
Tags: blog, one-column, custom-background, custom-colors, custom-logo, custom-menu, editor-style, featured-images, footer-widgets, full-width-template, rtl-language-support, sticky-post, theme-options, threaded-comments, translation-ready, block-styles, wide-blocks, accessibility-ready
Version: 1.3
Requires at least: 5.0
Tested up to: 5.4
Requires PHP: 7.0
License: GNU General Public License v2 or later
License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
Text Domain: twentytwenty
This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.
*/
```

WordPress Theme Repository uses the number after “Version” in this file to determine if the theme has a new version available.

### Explanations

Items indicated with (*\**) are required for a theme in the WordPress Theme Repository.

- **Theme Name** (\*): Name of the theme.
- **Theme URI**: The URL of a public web page where users can find more information about the theme.
- **Author** (\*): The name of the individual or organization who developed the theme. Using the Theme Author’s wordpress.org username is recommended.
- **Author URI**: The URL of the authoring individual or organization.
- **Description** (\*): A short description of the theme.
- **Version** (\*): The version of the theme, written in X.X or X.X.X format.
- **Requires at least (\*)**: The oldest main WordPress version the theme will work with, written in X.X format. Themes are only required to support the three last versions.
- **Tested up to (\*):** The last main WordPress version the theme has been tested up to, i.e. 5.4. Write only the number, in X.X format.
- **Requires PHP (\*)**: The oldest PHP version supported, in X.X format, only the number
- **License** (\*): The license of the theme.
- **License URI** (\*): The URL of the theme license.
- **Text Domain** (\*): The string used for textdomain for translation.
- **Tags**: Words or phrases that allow users to find the theme using the tag filter. A full list of tags is in the [Theme Review Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/theme-tags/).
- **Domain Path**: Used so that WordPress knows where to find the translation when the theme is disabled. Defaults to `/languages`.

After the required header section, style.css can contain anything a regular CSS file has.

## Style.css for a Child Theme

If your theme is a Child Theme, the **Template** line is required in style.css header.

```css
/*
Theme Name: My Child Theme
Template: twentytwenty
*/
```

For more information on creating a Child Theme, visit the [Child Themes](/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/) page.

# Sticky Posts <a name="themes/functionality/sticky-posts" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/sticky-posts/

A Sticky Post is the post will be placed at the top of the front page of posts. This feature is only available for the built-in post type post and not for custom post types.

## How to stick a post

1. Go to **Administration Screen &gt; Posts &gt; Add New** or **Edit**
2. In the right side menu, Click Edit link of Visibility option in Publish group
3. Click Stick this post to the front page option

![](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2017/01/sticked_post.jpg?resize=307%2C449&ssl=1)## Display Sticky Posts

### Show Sticky Posts

Display just the first sticky post. At least one post must be designated as a “sticky post” or else the loop will display all posts:

```php
<?php
$sticky = get_option( 'sticky_posts' );
$query  = new WP_Query( 'p=' . $sticky[0] );
```

Display just the first sticky post, if none return the last post published:

```php
<?php
$args  = array(
	'posts_per_page'      => 1,
	'post__in'            => get_option( 'sticky_posts' ),
	'ignore_sticky_posts' => 1,
);
$query = new WP_Query( $args );
```

Display just the first sticky post, if none return nothing:

```php
<?php
$args   = array(
	'posts_per_page'      => 1,
	'post__in'            => get_option( 'sticky_posts' ),
	'ignore_sticky_posts' => 1,
);
$query  = new WP_Query( $args );
if ( isset( $sticky[0] ) ) {
	// Insert here your stuff...
}
```

### Don’t Show Sticky Posts

Exclude all sticky posts from the query:

```php
<?php
$args  = array( 'post__not_in' => get_option( 'sticky_posts' ) );
$query = new WP_Query( $args );
```

Exclude sticky posts from a category. Return ALL posts within the category, but don’t show sticky posts at the top. The ‘sticky posts’ will still show in their natural position (e.g. by date):

```php
<?php
$args  = array(
	'ignore_sticky_posts' => 1,
	'posts_per_page'      => 3,
	'cat'                 => 6,
);
$query = new WP_Query( $args );
```

Exclude sticky posts from a category. Return posts within the category, but exclude sticky posts completely, and adhere to paging rules:

```php
<?php
$args  = array(
	'cat'                 => 3,
	'ignore_sticky_posts' => 1,
	'post__not_in'        => get_option( 'sticky_posts' ),
	'paged'               => get_query_var( 'paged' ) ? get_query_var( 'paged' ) : 1,
);
$query = new WP_Query( $args );
```

Use get_query_var( ‘page’ ) if you want this query to work in a Page template that you’ve set as your static front page.

```php
<?php
/* Get all Sticky Posts */
$sticky = get_option( 'sticky_posts' );

/* Sort Sticky Posts, newest at the top */
rsort( $sticky );

/* Get top 5 Sticky Posts */
$sticky = array_slice( $sticky, 0, 5 );

/* Query Sticky Posts */
$query = new WP_Query( array(
	'post__in'            => $sticky,
	'ignore_sticky_posts' => 1,
) );
```

## Style Sticky Posts

To help theme authors perform simpler styling, the [post\_class()](#reference/functions/post_class) function is used to add class=”…” to DIV, just add:

```php
<div id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>" <?php post_class(); ?>>
```

The [post\_class()](#reference/functions/post_class) outputs the class=”whatever” piece for that div. This includes several different classes of value: post, hentry (for hAtom microformat pages), category-X (where X is the slug of every category the post is in), and tag-X (similar, but with tags). It also adds “sticky” for posts marked as Sticky Posts.

```css
.sticky { color: red; }
```

The “sticky” class is only added for sticky posts on the first page of the home page ([is\_home()](#reference/functions/is_home) is true and [is\_paged()](#reference/functions/is_paged) is false)

# Customizer Objects <a name="themes/customize-api/customizer-objects" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/customize-api/customizer-objects/

The Customize API is object-oriented. There are four main types of Customizer objects: Panels, Sections, Settings, and Controls. Settings associate UI elements (controls) with settings that are saved in the database. Sections are UI containers for controls, to improve their organization. Panels are containers for sections, allowing multiple sections to be grouped together.

Each Customizer object is represented by a PHP class, and all of the objects are managed by the Customize Manager object, [WP\_Customize\_Manager](#reference/classes/wp_customize_manager).

[![Graphic showing the relationship between each type of customize object](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2017/01/Customize-Object-Hierarchy-Graphic.png?resize=640%2C360&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2017/01/Customize-Object-Hierarchy-Graphic.png?ssl=1)

To add, remove, or modify any Customizer object, and to access the Customizer Manager, use the `<a href="#reference/hooks/customize_register">customize_register</a>` hook:

```php
function themeslug_customize_register( $wp_customize ) {
  // Do stuff with $wp_customize, the WP_Customize_Manager object.
}
add_action( 'customize_register', 'themeslug_customize_register' );
```

The Customizer Manager provides add\_, get\_, and remove\_ methods for each Customizer object type; each works with an id. The get\_ methods allow for direct modification of parameters specified when adding a control.

```php
add_action('customize_register','my_customize_register');
function my_customize_register( $wp_customize ) {
  $wp_customize->add_panel();
  $wp_customize->get_panel();
  $wp_customize->remove_panel();

  $wp_customize->add_section();
  $wp_customize->get_section();
  $wp_customize->remove_section();

  $wp_customize->add_setting();
  $wp_customize->get_setting();
  $wp_customize->remove_setting();

  $wp_customize->add_control();
  $wp_customize->get_control();
  $wp_customize->remove_control();
}
```

Note: themes generally should not modify core sections and panels with the get methods, since themes should not modify core, theme-agnostic functionality. Plugins are encouraged to use these functions where necessary. Themes should not “reorganize” customizer sections that aren’t added by the theme.

## Settings

Settings handle live-previewing, saving, and sanitization of your customizer objects. Each setting is managed by a control object. There are several parameters available when adding a new setting:

```php
$wp_customize->add_setting( 'setting_id', array(
  'type' => 'theme_mod', // or 'option'
  'capability' => 'edit_theme_options',
  'theme_supports' => '', // Rarely needed.
  'default' => '',
  'transport' => 'refresh', // or postMessage
  'sanitize_callback' => '',
  'sanitize_js_callback' => '', // Basically to_json.
) );
```

**Important:** Do *not* use a setting ID that looks like `widget_*`, `sidebars_widgets[*]`, `nav_menu[*]`, or `nav_menu_item[*]`. These setting ID patterns are reserved for widget instances, sidebars, nav menus, and nav menu items respectively. If you need to use “widget” in your setting ID, use it as a suffix instead of a prefix, for example “`homepage_widget`”.

There are two primary types of settings: options and theme modifications. Options are stored directly in the wp\_options table of the WordPress database and apply to the site regardless of the active theme. Themes should rarely if ever add settings of the option type. Theme mods, on the other hand, are specific to a particular theme. Most theme options should be theme\_mods. For example, a custom CSS plugin could register a custom theme css setting as a theme\_mod, allowing each theme to have a unique set of CSS rules without losing the CSS when switching themes then switching back.

[![customize-theme-mods-options](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/customize-theme-mods-options.png?resize=640%2C359&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/customize-theme-mods-options.png?ssl=1)Theme\_mod vs. option setting type example.

It is usually most important to set the default value of the setting as well as its sanitization callback, which will ensure that no unsafe data is stored in the database. Typical theme usage:

```php
$wp_customize->add_setting( 'accent_color', array(
  'default' => '#f72525',
  'sanitize_callback' => 'sanitize_hex_color',
) );
```

Typical plugin usage:

```php
$wp_customize->add_setting( 'myplugin_options[color]', array(
  'type' => 'option',
  'capability' => 'manage_options',
  'default' => '#ff2525',
  'sanitize_callback' => 'sanitize_hex_color',
) );
```

Note that the Customizer can handle options stored as keyed arrays for settings using the option type. This allows multiple settings to be stored in a single option that isn’t a theme mod. To retrieve and use the values of your Customizer options, use `<a href="#reference/functions/get_theme_mod">get_theme_mod()</a>` and `<a href="#reference/functions/get_option">get_option()</a>` with the setting id:

```php
function my_custom_css_output() {
  echo '<style type="text/css" id="custom-theme-css">' .
  get_theme_mod( 'custom_theme_css', '' ) . '</style>';
  echo '<style type="text/css" id="custom-plugin-css">' .
  get_option( 'custom_plugin_css', '' ) . '</style>';
}
add_action( 'wp_head', 'my_custom_css_output');
```

Note that the second argument for `<a href="#reference/functions/get_theme_mod">get_theme_mod()</a>` and `<a href="#reference/functions/get_option">get_option()</a>` is the default value, which should match the default you set when adding the setting.

## Controls

Controls are the primary Customizer object for creating UI. Specifically, every control must be associated with a setting, and that setting will save user-entered data from the control to the database (in addition to displaying it in the live-preview and sanitizing it). Controls can be added by the Customizer Manager and provide a robust set of UI options with minimal effort:

```php
$wp_customize->add_control( 'setting_id', array(
  'type' => 'date',
  'priority' => 10, // Within the section.
  'section' => 'colors', // Required, core or custom.
  'label' => __( 'Date' ),
  'description' => __( 'This is a date control with a red border.' ),
  'input_attrs' => array(
    'class' => 'my-custom-class-for-js',
    'style' => 'border: 1px solid #900',
    'placeholder' => __( 'mm/dd/yyyy' ),
  ),
  'active_callback' => 'is_front_page',
) );
```

The most important parameter when adding a control is its type — this determines what type of UI the Customizer will display. Core provides several built-in control types:

- `<input>` elements with any allowed type (see below)
- `checkbox`
- `textarea`
- `radio` (pass a keyed array of values =&gt; labels to the `choices` argument)
- `select` (pass a keyed array of values =&gt; labels to the `choices` argument)
- `dropdown-pages` (use the `allow_addition` argument to allow users to add new pages from the control)

For any input type supported by the html `input` element, simply pass the type attribute value to the type parameter when adding the control. This allows support for control types such as `text`, `hidden`, `number`, `range`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, `search`, `time`, `date`, `datetime`, and `week`, pending browser support.

Controls must be added to a section before they will be displayed (and sections must contain controls to be displayed). This is done by specifying the section parameter when adding the control. Here is an example for adding a basic textarea control:

```php
$wp_customize->add_control( 'custom_theme_css', array(
  'label' => __( 'Custom Theme CSS' ),
  'type' => 'textarea',
  'section' => 'custom_css',
) );
```

And here’s an example of a basic range (slider) control. Note that most browsers will not display the numeric value of this control because the range input type is designed for settings where the exact value is unimportant. If the numeric value is important, consider using the number type. The `input_attrs` parameter will map a keyed array of attributes =&gt; values to attributes on the input element, and can be used for purposes ranging from placeholder text to `data-` JavaScript-referenced data in custom scripts. For number and range controls, it allows us to set the minimum, maximum, and step values.

```php
$wp_customize->add_control( 'setting_id', array(
  'type' => 'range',
  'section' => 'title_tagline',
  'label' => __( 'Range' ),
  'description' => __( 'This is the range control description.' ),
  'input_attrs' => array(
    'min' => 0,
    'max' => 10,
    'step' => 2,
  ),
) );
```

### Core Custom Controls

If none of the basic control types suit your needs, you can easily create and add custom controls. Custom controls are explained more fully later in this post, but they are essentially subclasses of the base `<a href="#reference/classes/wp_customize_control">WP_Customize_Control</a>` object that allow any arbitrary html markup and functionality that you might need. Core features several built-in custom controls that allow developers to implement rich JavaScript-driven features with ease. A color picker control can be added as follows:

```php
$wp_customize->add_control( new WP_Customize_Color_Control( $wp_customize, 'color_control', array(
  'label' => __( 'Accent Color', 'theme_textdomain' ),
  'section' => 'media',
) ) );
```

WordPress 4.1 and 4.2 also added support for any type of multimedia content, with the Media control. The media control implements the native WordPress media manager, allowing users to select files from their library or upload new ones. By specifying the `mime_type` parameter when adding the control, you can instruct the media library show to a specific type such as images or audio:

```php
$wp_customize->add_control( new WP_Customize_Media_Control( $wp_customize, 'image_control', array(
  'label' => __( 'Featured Home Page Image', 'theme_textdomain' ),
  'section' => 'media',
  'mime_type' => 'image',
) ) );
```

```php
$wp_customize->add_control( new WP_Customize_Media_Control( $wp_customize, 'audio_control', array(
  'label' => _( 'Featured Home Page Recording', 'theme_textdomain' ),
  'section' => 'media',
  'mime_type' => 'audio',
) ) );
```

Note that settings associated with `WP_Customize_Media_Control `save the associated attachment ID, while all other media-related controls (children of `WP_Customize_Upload_Control`) save the media file URL to the setting. [More information](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/16/new-customizer-media-controls-in-4-3-and-4-2/) is available on Make WordPress Core.

Additionally, WordPress 4.3 introduced the `WP_Customize_Cropped_Image_Control`, which provides an interface for cropping an image after selecting it. This is useful for instances where a particular aspect ratio is needed.

## Sections

Sections are UI containers for Customizer controls. While you can add custom controls to the core sections, if you have more than a few options you may want to add one or more custom sections. Use the `<a href="#reference/classes/wp_customize_manageradd_section/">add_section</a>` method of the [WP\_Customize\_Manager](#reference/classes/wp_customize_manager) object to add a new section:

```php
$wp_customize->add_section( 'custom_css', array(
  'title' => __( 'Custom CSS' ),
  'description' => __( 'Add custom CSS here' ),
  'panel' => '', // Not typically needed.
  'priority' => 160,
  'capability' => 'edit_theme_options',
  'theme_supports' => '', // Rarely needed.
) );
```

You only need to include fields that you want to override the default values of. For example, the default priority (order of appearance) is typically acceptable, and most sections shouldn’t require descriptive text if your options are self-explanatory. If you do want to change the location of your custom section, the priorities of the core sections are below:

| Title | ID | Priority (Order) |
|---|---|---|
| Site Title &amp; Tagline | title\_tagline | 20 |
| Colors | colors | 40 |
| Header Image | header\_image | 60 |
| Background Image | background\_image | 80 |
| Menus (Panel) | nav\_menus | 100 |
| Widgets (Panel) | widgets | 110 |
| Static Front Page | static\_front\_page | 120 |
| *default* |  | 160 |
| Additional CSS | custom\_css | 200 |

In most cases, sections can be added with only one or two parameters being specified. Here’s an example for adding a section for options that pertain to a theme’s footer:

```php
// Add a footer/copyright information section.
$wp_customize->add_section( 'footer' , array(
  'title' => __( 'Footer', 'themename' ),
  'priority' => 105, // Before Widgets.
) );
```

## Panels

The Customizer Panels API was introduced in WordPress 4.0, and allows developers to create an additional layer of hierarchy beyond controls and sections. More than simply grouping sections of controls, panels are designed to provide distinct contexts for the Customizer, such as Customizing Widgets, Menus, or perhaps in the future, editing posts. There is an important technical distinction between the section and panel objects.

**Themes should not register their own panels in most cases**. Sections do *not* need to be nested under a panel, and each section should generally contain multiple controls. Controls should also be added to the Sections that core provides, such as adding color options to the colors Section. Also make sure that your options are as streamlined and efficient as possible; see the [WordPress philosophy](https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/). Panels are designed as contexts for entire features such as Widgets, Menus, or Posts, not as wrappers for generic sections. If you absolutely must use Panels, you’ll find that the API is nearly identical to that for Sections:

```php
$wp_customize->add_panel( 'menus', array(
  'title' => __( 'Menus' ),
  'description' => $description, // Include html tags such as <p>.
  'priority' => 160, // Mixed with top-level-section hierarchy.
) );
$wp_customize->add_section( $section_id , array(
  'title' => $menu->name,
  'panel' => 'menus',
) );
```

Panels must contain at least one Section, which must contain at least one Control, to be displayed. As you can see in the above example, Sections can be added to Panels similarly to how Controls are added to Sections. However, unlike with controls, if the Panel parameter is empty when registering a Section, it will be displayed on the main, top-level Customizer context, as most sections should not be contained with a panel.

## Custom Controls, Sections, and Panels

Custom Controls, Sections, and Panels can be easily created by subclassing the PHP objects associated with each Customizer object: `<a href="#reference/classes/wp_customize_control">WP_Customize_Control</a>`, `<a href="#reference/classes/wp_customize_section">WP_Customize_Section</a>`, and `<a href="#reference/classes/wp_customize_panel">WP_Customize_Panel</a>` (this can also be done for `<a href="#reference/classes/wp_customize_setting">WP_Customize_Setting</a>`, but custom settings are typically better implemented using custom setting types, as outlined in the next section). Here’s an example for a basic custom control:

```php
class WP_New_Menu_Customize_Control extends WP_Customize_Control {
  public $type = 'new_menu';
  /**
  * Render the control's content.
  */
  public function render_content() {
  ?>
    <button class="button button-primary" id="create-new-menu-submit" tabindex="0"><?php _e( 'Create Menu' ); ?></button>
  <?php
  }
}
```

By subclassing the base control class, you can override any functionality with custom functionality or use the core functionality depending on your needs. The most common function to override is `render_content()` as it allows you to create custom UI from scratch with HTML. Custom Controls should be used with caution, however, as they may introduce UI that is inconsistent with the surrounding core UI and cause confusion for users. Custom Customizer objects can be added similarly to how default controls, sections, and panels are added:

```php
$wp_customize->add_control(
  new WP_Customize_Color_Control(
    $wp_customize, // WP_Customize_Manager
    'accent_color', // Setting id
    array( // Args, including any custom ones.
      'label' => __( 'Accent Color' ),
      'section' => 'colors',
    )
  )
);
```

Parameters passed when adding controls are mapped to class variables within the control class, so you can add and use custom ones where certain parts of your custom object are different across different instances.

When creating custom Controls, Sections, or Panels, it is strongly recommended to reference the core code, in order to fully understand the available functionality that can be overridden. Core also includes examples of custom objects of each type. This can be found in [wp-includes/class-wp-customize-control.php](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/class-wp-customize-control.php), [wp-includes/class-wp-customize-section.php](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/class-wp-customize-section.php), and [wp-includes/class-wp-customize-panel.php](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/class-wp-customize-panel.php). There is also a JavaScript API for each Customizer object type, which can be extended with custom objects; see the Customizer JavaScript API section for more details.

### Customizer UI Standards

Custom customizer controls, sections, and panels should match core UI practices wherever possible. This includes relying on standards from wp-admin, such as using the `.button` and `.button-primary` classes, for example. There are also a few standards specific to the customizer (as of WordPress 4.7):

- White background colors are used *only* to indicate navigation and actionable items (such as inputs)
- The general `#eee` background color provides visual contrast against the white elements
- `1px #ddd` borders separate navigational elements from background margins and from each other
- `15px` of spacing is provided between elements where visual separation is desired
- `4px` borders are used on one side of a navigation element to show hover or focus, with a color of `#0073aa`
- Customizer text uses `color: #555d66`, with `#0073aa` for hover and focus states on navigation elements

## Custom Setting Types

By default, the Customizer supports saving settings as options or theme modifications. But this behavior can be easily overwritten to manually save and preview settings outside of the wp\_options table of the WordPress database, or to apply other custom handling. To get started, specify a type other than option or theme\_mod when adding your setting (you can use pretty much any string):

```php
$wp_customize->add_setting( $nav_menu_setting_id, array(
  'type' => 'nav_menu',
  'default' => $item_ids,
) );
```

The setting will no longer be saved or previewed when its value is changed in the associated control. Now, you can use the `customize_update_$setting->type `and` customize_preview_$setting->type` actions to implement custom saving and previewing functionality. Here is an example for saving a menu item’s order property from the Menu Customizer project (the value of the setting is an ordered array of menu ids):

```php
function menu_customizer_update_nav_menu( $value, $setting ) {
  $menu_id = str_replace( 'nav_menu_', '', $setting->id );
  // ...
  $i = 0;
  foreach( $value as $item_id ) { // $value is ordered array of item ids.
    menu_customizer_update_menu_item_order( $menu_id, $item_id, $i );
  $i++;
  }
}
add_action( 'customize_update_nav_menu', 'menu_customizer_update_nav_menu', 10, 2 );
```

And here is how the same plugin implements previewing for nav menu items (note that this example requires PHP 5.3 or higher):

```php
function menu_customizer_preview_nav_menu( $setting ) {
  $menu_id = str_replace( 'nav_menu_', '', $setting->id );
  add_filter( 'wp_get_nav_menu_items', function( $items, $menu, $args ) use ( $menu_id, $setting ) {
    $preview_menu_id = $menu->term_id;
    if ( $menu_id == $preview_menu_id ) {
      $new_ids = $setting->post_value();
      foreach ( $new_ids as $item_id ) {
        $item = wp_setup_nav_menu_item( $item );
        $item->menu_order = $i;
        $new_items[] = $item;
        $i++;
      }
      return $new_items;
    } else {
      return $items;
    }
  }, 10, 3 );
}
add_action( 'customize_preview_nav_menu', 'menu_customizer_preview_nav_menu', 10, 2 );
```

# Tools for Improved User Experience <a name="themes/customize-api/tools-for-improved-user-experience" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/customize-api/tools-for-improved-user-experience/

## Contextual Controls, Sections, and Panels

WordPress 4.0 and 4.1 also added support for making parts of the Customizer UI be visible or hidden depending on the part of the site that the user was previewing within the Customizer preview window. A simple contextual control example would be that your theme only displays the header image and the site tagline on the front page. This is a perfect use case for the Customizer Manager’s get\_ methods, as we can modify the core controls for these settings directly to make them contextual to the front page: ```php
// Hide core sections/controls when they aren't used on the current page.

$wp_customize->get_section( 'header_image' )->active_callback = 'is_front_page';

$wp_customize->get_control( 'blogdescription' )->active_callback = 'is_front_page';
```

![](//i1.wp.com/nick.halsey.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/08/contextual-customize-controls.gif)In this contextual control example, the theme only displays the site tagline on the front page, so the corresponding field in the Customizer is hidden when the user navigates to a different page within the preview window.The `active_callback` parameter for Panels, Sections, and Controls takes a callback function name, either core or custom. This parameter can also be set when registering the object for objects that you add. Here’s an example from the Twenty Fourteen Theme: ```php
$wp_customize->add_section( 'featured_content', array(

  'title'       => __( 'Featured Content', 'twentyfourteen' ),

  'description' => //...

  'priority'        => 130,

  'active_callback' => 'is_front_page',

) );
```

In the previous example, `<a href="#reference/functions/is_front_page">is_front_page</a>` is used directly. But for more complex logic, such as checking if the current view is a page (or even a specific page, by id), custom functions can be used (see [\#30251](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30251) for details on why this is needed). If you don’t need to support PHP 5.2, this can be done inline: ```php
'active_callback' => function () { return is_page(); }
```

PHP 5.2 support is as simple as creating a named function and referencing it with the active\_callback parameter: ```php
//...

'active_callback' => 'prefix_return_is_page';

//...

function prefix_return_is_page() {

  return is_page();

}
```

Within Custom Controls, Sections, and Panels, there is also an option to override the `active_callback` function directly within the custom Customizer object class: ```php
class WP_Customize_Greeting_Control extends WP_Customize_Control {

  // ...

  function active_callback() {

    return is_front_page();

  }

}
```

Finally, there is a filter that can be used to override all other `active_callback` behavior: ```php
// Hide all controls without a description when previewing single posts.

function title_tagline_control_filter( $active, $control ) {

  if ( '' === $control->description ) {

    $active = is_singular();

  }

  return $active;

}

add_filter( 'customize_control_active', 'title_tagline_control_filter', 10, 2 );
```

Note that the `active_callback` API works exactly the same for all of the Customizer object types (Controls, [Sections](#reference/classes/wp_customize_section/active_callback), and [Panels](#reference/classes/wp_customize_panel/active_callback)). As an added bonus, sections will automatically be hidden if all of the controls within them are contextually hidden, and the same works for panels. ## Selective Refresh: Fast, Accurate Updates

Introduced in WordPress 4.5, Selective Refresh updates in the Customizer “preview” only refresh areas whose associate settings are changed. By only updating the elements that have changed, it’s much faster and less disruptive than a full-iframe refresh. Some other benefits, as noted in [Selective Refresh In The Customizer](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/16/selective-refresh-in-the-customizer), are: - Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) logic
- Accurate preview update
- Association between parts of the preview and associated settings and controls, along with visible edit shortcuts [as of WordPress 4.7](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/10/visible-edit-shortcuts-in-the-customizer-preview/)

The logic in pure-JavaScript `postMessage` updates is duplicated. The JavaScript in the Customizer must mirror the PHP that produces the markup, or take shortcuts to approximate it. But Selective Refresh is DRY as there’s no duplication of JavaScript and PHP. An Ajax request retrieves the new markup for the preview. And because of this Ajax call, the refresh is **accurate**. It uses the filters that can alter the markup. It shows the same result that appears on the front end. Additionally, selective refresh partials provide an association between areas of the preview and their corresponding settings. The customizer leverages this relationship to provide visible edit shortcuts that help users find controls associated with a particular part of their site. In the future the partials API could expand to facilitate editing settings directly within the preview and to include a structured JS API for previewing settings with partials. For these reasons, all settings are strongly recommended to leverage selective refresh transport for improved user experience, with the option of providing additional JavaScript-based transport to further enhance setting previewing. ### Registering Partials

Setting previews need to opt-in to use Selective Refresh by registering the necessary partials. In this example, largely taken from the them [Twenty Sixteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen), Selective Refresh is added for the `blogdescription` setting by adding a partial with the same name. ```php
function foo_theme_customize_register( WP_Customize_Manager $wp_customize ) {

    $wp_customize->selective_refresh->add_partial( 'blogdescription', array(

        'selector' => '.site-description',

        'container_inclusive' => false,

        'render_callback' => function() {

            bloginfo( 'description' );

        },

    ) );

}

add_action( 'customize_register', 'foo_theme_customize_register' );
```

If the `settings` argument is not supplied, it defaults to be the same as the partial ID, in the same way as the settings for controls default to the control ID. Here are some of the key arguments for partials: | **Variable** | **Type** | **Description** |
|---|---|---|
| `settings` | array | Setting IDs associated with the partial. |
| `selector` | string | Targets the element(s) in the page markup to be refreshed. |
| `container_inclusive` | boolean | If true, a refresh replaces the entire container. Otherwise, it only replaces the container’s children. Defaults to false. |
| `render_callback` | function | Produces the markup to be rendered on refresh. |
| `fallback_refresh` | bool | Whether or not a full page refresh should occur if the partial is not found in the document. |

### Selective Refresh JavaScript Events

These fire on `wp.customize.selectiveRefresh`: - `partial-content-rendered`When the placement is rendered. As mentioned, JavaScript-driven widgets can re-build on this event.
- `render-partials-response`When data is returned, after a request for partial rendering. The server filters this data with ‘customize\_render\_partials\_response’.
- `partial-content-moved`When a widget has moved in its sidebar. As shown above, JavaScript-driven widgets can refresh on this event.
- `widget-updated`When the `WidgetPartial` is refreshed with its `renderContent` method.
- `sidebar-updated`When a sidebar has a widget that’s refreshed or updated. Or when a sidebar’s widgets are sorted, using `reflowWidgets()`.

### Widgets: Opting-In To Selective Refresh

Both themes and widgets **need to opt-in** to use Selective Refresh. All core widgets and themes have already enabled this. #### Theme Support In Sidebars

In order to allow partial refreshes of widgets in a theme’s sidebars: ```php
add_theme_support( 'customize-selective-refresh-widgets' );
```

**Important:** Selective refresh for widgets requires that the theme include a `before_widget`/`after_widget` wrapper element around each widget that contains the widget’s ID. Such wrappers are the default when you `register_sidebar()`. For example: ```php
function example_widgets_init() {

	register_sidebar(

		array(

			'name'          => esc_html__( 'Sidebar', 'example' ),

			'id'            => 'sidebar-1',

			'description'   => esc_html__( 'Add widgets here.', 'example' ),

			'before_widget' => '<section id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">', // <= Key for selective refresh.

			'after_widget'  => '</section>',

			'before_title'  => '<h2 class="widget-title">',

			'after_title'   => '</h2>',

		)

	);

}

add_action( 'widgets_init', 'example_widgets_init' );
```

#### Widget Support

Even if a theme supports Selective Refresh, widgets also have to opt-in. All core widgets have already enabled it. Here’s an example widget adding support for Selective Refresh: ```php
class Foo_Widget extends WP_Widget {

    public function __construct() {

        parent::__construct(

            ‘foo’,

            __( 'Example', 'bar-plugin' ),

            array(

                'description' => __( ‘An example widget’, ‘bar-plugin’ ),

                'customize_selective_refresh' => true,

            )

        );

        if ( is_active_widget( false, false, $this->id_base ) || is_customize_preview() ) {

            add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', array( $this, 'enqueue_scripts' ) );

        }

    }

    ...
```

Line 9 above enables Selective Refresh: ```php
'customize_selective_refresh' => true,
```

Line 13 above ensures the widget’s stylesheet always appears in Customizer sessions. Adding the widget won’t cause a full-page refresh to retrieve the styling: ```php
if ( is_active_widget( false, false, $this->id_base ) || is_customize_preview() ) {

    add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', array( $this, 'enqueue_scripts' ) );

}
```

See [Implementing Selective Refresh Support for Widgets](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/22/implementing-selective-refresh-support-for-widgets/). #### JavaScript-Driven Widget Support

Widgets that rely on JavaScript for their markup will need additional steps, as shown in [Implementing Selective Refresh Support for Widgets](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/22/implementing-selective-refresh-support-for-widgets/): 1. Enqueue any JavaScript files based on `is_customize_preview()`, as shown above for stylesheets.
2. Add a handler for the `partial-content-rendered` event, and refresh the widget as needed:

```js
wp.customize.selectiveRefresh.bind( 'partial-content-rendered', function( placement ) {

    // logic to refresh

} );
```

1. If the widget includes an iframe, add a handler to refresh the partial:

```js
wp.customize.selectiveRefresh.bind( 'partial-content-moved', function( placement ) {

    // logic to refresh, perhaps conditionally

}
```

## Using PostMessage For Improved Setting Previewing

The Customizer automatically handles previewing all settings out-of-the-box. This is done by silently reloading the entire preview window, with settings being filtered by PHP in that Ajax call. While this works just fine, it can be very slow since the entire front-end must be reloaded for every single setting change. Selective Refresh improves this experience by refreshing only the elements that have changed, but due to the Ajax call, there is still a delay in seeing the changes in the preview. To further improve the user experience, the Customizer offers an API for managing setting changes directly in JavaScript, allowing for truly-live previewing. The below images show a comparison of a Custom CSS option that leverages this technology, called `postMessage`, versus the standard refresh option: ![](//i1.wp.com/nick.halsey.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/08/customize-setting-postmessage.gif)Custom CSS setting in the Customizer with the postMessage setting transport.![](//i1.wp.com/nick.halsey.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/08/customize-setting-refresh-1.gif)Custom CSS setting in the Customizer with the default refresh setting transport.To use postMessage, first set the transport parameter to postMessage when adding your setting. Many themes also modify core settings such as the title and tagline to leverage postMessage by modifying the transport property of those settings: ```php
$wp_customize->get_setting( 'blogname' )->transport        = 'postMessage';

$wp_customize->get_setting( 'blogdescription' )->transport = 'postMessage';
```

Once the setting’s transport is set to postMessage, the setting will no longer trigger a refresh of the preview when its value changes. To implement the JavaScript to update the setting within the preview of the front-end, first create and enqueue a JavaScript file: ```php
function my_preview_js() {

  wp_enqueue_script( 'custom_css_preview', 'path/to/file.js', array( 'customize-preview', 'jquery' ) );

}

add_action( 'customize_preview_init', 'my_preview_js' );
```

Your JavaScript file should look something like this: ```js
( function( $ ) {

  wp.customize( 'setting_id', function( value ) {

    value.bind( function( to ) {

      $( '#custom-theme-css' ).html( to );

    } );

  } );

  wp.customize( 'custom_plugin_css', function( value ) {

    value.bind( function( to ) {

      $( '#custom-plugin-css' ).html( to );

    } );

  } );

} )( jQuery );
```

Note that you don’t necessarily need to be great with JavaScript to use postMessage – most of the code is boilerplate. The types of settings that benefit most from postMessage transport require simple JS changes such as using jQuery’s .html() or .text() methods, or swapping out a class on the `<body>` or another element to trigger a different set of CSS rules. Doing this, or simplifying the instant preview logic with fully-accurate changes updating with selective refresh, the user experience can be fast without duplicating all of the PHP logic in JS. ## Setting Validation

WordPress 4.6 includes new APIs related to validation of Customizer setting values. The Customizer has had sanitization of setting values since it was introduced. Sanitization involves coercing a value into something safe to persist to the database: common examples are converting a value into an integer or stripping tags from some text input. As such, sanitization is a *lossy* operation. With the addition of setting validation: 1. All modified settings are validated up-front before any of them are saved.
2. If any setting is invalid, the Customizer save request is rejected: a save thus becomes *transactional* with all the settings left dirty to try saving again. (The Customizer [transactions proposal](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/01/26/customizer-transactions-proposal/) is closely related to setting validation here.)
3. Validation error messages are displayed to the user, prompting them to fix their mistake and try again.

Sanitization and validation are also both part of the REST API infrastructure via `WP_REST_Request::sanitize_params()` and `WP_REST_Request::validate_params()`, respectively. A setting’s value goes through validation before it goes through sanitization. For more information on the validation behavior, and additional code examples, see [the feature announcement post](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/05/customizer-apis-in-4-6-for-setting-validation-and-notifications/). ### Validating Settings in PHP

Just as you can supply a `sanitize_callback` when registering a setting, you can also supply a `validate_callback` arg: ```php
$wp_customize->add_setting( 'established_year', array(

    'sanitize_callback' => 'absint',

    'validate_callback' => 'validate_established_year'

) );

function validate_established_year( $validity, $value ) {

    $value = intval( $value );

    if ( empty( $value ) || ! is_numeric( $value ) ) {

        $validity->add( 'required', __( 'You must supply a valid year.' ) );

    } elseif ( $value &lt; 1900 ) {

        $validity->add( 'year_too_small', __( 'Year is too old.' ) );

    } elseif ( $value > gmdate( 'Y' ) ) {

        $validity->add( 'year_too_big', __( 'Year is too new.' ) );

    }

    return $validity;

}
```

Just as supplying a `sanitize_callback` arg adds a filter for `customize_sanitize_{$setting_id}`, so too supplying a `validate_callback` arg will add a filter for `customize_validate_{$setting_id}`. Assuming that the `WP_Customize_Setting` instances apply filters on these in their `validate` methods, you can add this filter if you need to add validation for settings that have been previously added. The `validate_callback` and any `customize_validate_{$setting_id}` filter callbacks take a `WP_Error` instance is its first argument (which initially is empty of any errors added), followed by the `$value` being sanitized, and lastly the `WP_Customize_Setting` instance that is being validated. Custom setting classes can also override the `validate `method of the setting class directly. ### Client-side Validation

If you have a setting that is previewed purely via JavaScript (and the `postMessage` transport *without* selective refresh), you should also add client-side validation. Otherwise, any validation errors will persist until a full refresh happens or a save is attempted. Client-side validation must not take the place of server-side validation, since malicious users could bypass the client-side validation to save an invalid value if corresponding server-side validation is not in place. There is a `validate` method available on the `wp.customize.Setting` JS class (actually, the `wp.customize.Value` base class). Its name is a bit misleading, as it actually behaves very similarly to the `WP_Customize_Setting::sanitize()` PHP method, but it can be used to both sanitize and validate a value in JS. Note that this JS runs in the context of the Customizer *pane* not the preview, so any such JS should have `customize-controls` as a dependency (not `customize-preview`) and enqueued during the `customize_controls_enqueue_scripts` action. Some example JS validation: ```js
wp.customize( 'established_year', function ( setting ) {

	setting.validate = function ( value ) {

		var code, notification;

		var year = parseInt( value, 10 );

		code = 'required';

		if ( isNaN( year ) ) {

			notification = new wp.customize.Notification( code, {message: myPlugin.l10n.yearRequired} );

			setting.notifications.add( code, notification );

		} else {

			setting.notifications.remove( code );

		}

		code = 'year_too_small';

		if ( year &lt; 1900 ) {

			notification = new wp.customize.Notification( code, {message: myPlugin.l10n.yearTooSmall} );

			setting.notifications.add( code, notification );

		} else {

			setting.notifications.remove( code );

		}

		code = 'year_too_big';

		if ( year > new Date().getFullYear() ) {

			notification = new wp.customize.Notification( code, {message: myPlugin.l10n.yearTooBig} );

			setting.notifications.add( code, notification );

		} else {

			setting.notifications.remove( code );

		}

		return value;

	};

} );
```

## Notifications

![Error notification](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.org/core/files/2016/07/error-notification-300x112.png?resize=300%2C112&ssl=1)Notifications provide user feedback, typically based on the value of a control’s setting. An error notification is added to a setting’s `notifications` collection when a setting’s validation routine returns a `WP_Error` instance. Each error added to a PHP `WP_Error` instance is represented as a `wp.customize.Notification` in JavaScript: - A `WP_Error`‘s `code` is available as `notification.code` in JS.
- A `WP_Error`‘s `message` is available as `notification.message` in JS. Note that if there are multiple messages added to a given error code in PHP they will be concatenated into a single message in JS.
- A `WP_Error`‘s `data` is available as `notification.data` in JS. This is useful to pass additional error context from the server to the client.

Any time that a `WP_Error` is returned from a validation routine on the server it will result in a `wp.customize.Notification` being created with a `type` property of “error”. While setting non-error notifications from PHP is not currently supported (see #37281), you can also add non-error notifications with JS as follows: ```js
wp.customize( 'blogname', function( setting ) {

    setting.bind( function( value ) {

        var code = 'long_title';

        if ( value.length > 20 ) {

            setting.notifications.add( code, new wp.customize.Notification(

                code,

                {

                    type: 'warning',

                    message: 'This theme prefers title with max 20 chars.'

                }

            ) );

        } else {

            setting.notifications.remove( code );

        }

    } );

} );
```

You can also supply “info” as a notification’s `type`. The default `type` is “error”. Custom types may also be supplied, and the notifications can be styled with CSS selector matching `notice.notice-foo` where “foo” is the type supplied. A control may also override the default behavior for how notifications are rendered by overriding the `wp.customize.Control.renderNotifications` method.

# The Customizer JavaScript API <a name="themes/customize-api/the-customizer-javascript-api" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/customize-api/the-customizer-javascript-api/

In WordPress 4.1, newly-expanded JavaScript APIs were introduced for all customizer objects. The entire JavaScript API is currently located in a single file, [wp-admin/js/customize-controls.js](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/js/_enqueues/wp/customize/controls.js), which contains models for all objects, core custom controls, and more.

## Preview JS and Controls JS

The customizer app is currently split into two distinct areas: the customizer controls “pane” and the customize preview. The preview is currently in an iframe, meaning that all JS runs either in the controls pane or in the preview. The postMessage API is used to communicate between the preview and the controls.

Most themes only implement JavaScript in the customize preview, and use it to implement instant previewing of settings via postMessage. However, JS on the controls side can be used for many things, such as dynamically showing and hiding controls based on the values of other settings, changing the previewed URL, focusing parts of the preview, and more. Here’s an example from core of controls-side JS that interacts with the preview, in this case changing the previewed URL when the page for posts changes:

```javascript
// Change the previewed URL to the selected page when changing the page_for_posts.
wp.customize(
	'page_for_posts',
	function( setting ) {
		setting.bind( function( pageId ) {
			pageId = parseInt( pageId, 10 );
			if ( pageId > 0 ) {
				api.previewer.previewUrl.set( api.settings.url.home + '?page_id=' + pageId );
			}
		});
	}
);
```

Similar logic can be used to `activate` UI objects based on the value of a setting. The Twenty Seventeen theme includes some useful examples for leveraging the customize JS API for improved user experience. Note that there is one JS file for the controls pane, named `customize-controls.js` and one file for the customize preview, named customize-preview.js. For clarity, all themes and plugins are recommended to follow this naming convention, even if customize JS is only provided in the controls or preview but not both.

The rest of this page is dedicated primarily to the controls-side JS API that was built-out in WordPress 4.1.

## Models for Controls, Sections, and Panels

As in PHP, each Customizer object type has a corresponding object in JavaScript. There are `wp.customize.Control,` `wp.customize.Panel,` and `wp.customize.Section `models, as well as `wp.customize.panel,` `wp.customize.section, and ``wp.customize.control` collections (yes, they are singular) that store all control instances. You can iterate over panels, sections, and controls via:

```javascript
wp.customize.panel.each( function ( panel ) { /* ... */ } );
wp.customize.section.each( function ( section ) { /* ... */ } );
wp.customize.control.each( function ( control ) { /* ... */ } );
```

## Relating Controls, Sections, and Panels together

When registering a new control in PHP, you pass in the parent section ID:

```php
<?php
$wp_customize->add_control(
	'blogname',
	array(
		'label'   => __( 'Site Title' ),
		'section' => 'title_tagline',
	)
);
?>
```

In the JavaScript API, a control’s section can be obtained predictably:

```javascript
id = wp.customize.control( 'blogname' ).section(); // returns title_tagline by default
```

To get the section object from the ID, look up the section by the ID as normal: `wp.customize.section( id )`.

You can move a control to another section using this `section` state as well, here moving it to the Navigation section:

```javascript
wp.customize.control( 'blogname' ).section( 'nav' );
```

Likewise, you can get a section’s panel ID in the same way:

```javascript
id = wp.customize.section( 'sidebar-widgets-sidebar-1' ).panel(); // returns widgets by default
```

You can go the other way as well, to get the children of panels and sections:

```javascript
sections = wp.customize.panel( 'widgets' ).sections();controls = wp.customize.section( 'title_tagline' ).controls();
```

You can use these to move all controls from one section to another:

```javascript
_.each( wp.customize.section( 'title_tagline' ).controls(), function ( control ) {  
    control.section( 'nav' );
} );
```

## Contextual Panels, Sections, and Controls

`Control,` `Panel,` and `Section` instances have an `active` state (a `wp.customize.Value` instance). When the `active` state changes, the panel, section, and control instances invoke their respective `onChangeActive` method, which by default slides the container element up and down, if `false` and `true` respectively. There are also `activate()` and `deactivate()` methods now for manipulating this `active` state, for panels, sections, and controls. The primary purpose of these states is to show or hide the object without removing it entirely from the Customizer.

```javascript
wp.customize.section( 'nav' ).deactivate(); // slide up
wp.customize.section( 'nav' ).activate({ duration: 1000 }); // slide down slowly
wp.customize.section( 'colors' ).deactivate({ duration: 0 }); // hide immediately
wp.customize.section( 'nav' ).deactivate({ completeCallback:
function () {  
    wp.customize.section( 'colors' ).activate(); // show after nav hides completely
} } );
```

Note that manually changing the `active` state would only stick until the preview refreshes or loads another URL. The `activate()`/`deactivate()` methods are designed to follow the pattern of the new `expanded` state.

## Focusing UI Objects

Building upon the `expand()`/`collapse()` methods for panels, sections, and controls, these models also support a `focus()` method which not only expands all of the necessary elements, but also scrolls the target container into view and puts the browser focus on the first focusable element in the container. For instance, to expand the “Static Front Page” section and focus on select dropdown for the “Front page”:

```javascript
wp.customize.control( 'page_on_front' ).focus()
```

The focus functionality is used to implement [autofocus](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28650 "#28650: Allow Customizer elements (controls, sections, and panels) to be deep-linked"): deep-linking to panels, sections, and controls inside of the customizer. Consider these URLs:

- …/wp-admin/customize.php?autofocus\[panel\]=widgets
- …/wp-admin/customize.php?autofocus\[section\]=colors
- …/wp-admin/customize.php?autofocus\[control\]=blogname

This is used in WordPress core to [add a link](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28032 "#28032: Headers, Backgrounds, and Widgets in the Customizer are not discoverable from their separate admin screens.") on the widgets admin page to link directly to the widgets panel within the customizer, as well as to connect visible edit shortcuts in the customize preview with the associated controls in the customize pane.

## Priorities

When registering a panel, section, or control in PHP, you can supply a `priority` parameter. This value is stored in a `wp.customize.Value` instance for each respective `Panel`, `Section`, and `Control` instance. For example, you can obtain the priority for the widgets panel via:

```javascript
priority = wp.customize.panel( 'widgets' ).priority(); // returns 110 by default
```

You can then dynamically change the priority and the Customizer UI will automatically re-arrange to reflect the new priorities:

```javascript
wp.customize.panel( 'widgets' ).priority( 1 ); // move Widgets to the top
```

## Custom Controls, Panels, and Sections

When working with custom Customizer objects in JS, it is usually easiest to examine the custom objects in WordPress core to understand the code structure. See [wp-admin/js/customize-controls.js](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/js/_enqueues/wp/customize/controls.js), particularly the wp.customize.Panel|Section|Control models. Note several examples in the core code, particularly in the media controls, which build on each others’ functionality though object hierarchy.

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/customize-api/javascriptunderscore-js-rendered-custom-controls/

WordPress 4.1 also added support for rendering JavaScript-heavy and/or high-quantity controls entirely with JavaScript. This allows for more dynamic behavior, especially related to dynamically-added controls. The core Color and Media controls currently leverage this API, and all core Controls will eventually use it in the future. The PHP-based control API is not going away, but in the future most controls will likely use the new API since it provides a faster experience for users and developers. Similar APIs for JS-templated Sections and Panels were introduced WordPress 4.3; however, there remain some gaps in the ease of dynamically-creating objects in JS as of WordPress 4.7, see [\#30741](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30741).

## Registered Control Types

In order to introduce a concept of having one template for multiple Customizer controls of the same type, we needed to introduce a way to register a type of control with the Customize Manager. Previously, custom control objects were only encountered when custom controls were added using `<a href="#reference/classes/wp_customize_manager/add_control">WP_Customize_Manager::add_control()</a>`. But detecting added control types to render one template per type wouldn’t allow new controls to be created dynamically if no other instances of that type were loaded. `<a href="#reference/classes/wp_customize_manager/register_control_type">WP_Customize_Manager::register_control_type()</a> solves this:`

```php
add_action( 'customize_register', 'prefix_customize_register' );
function prefix_customize_register( $wp_customize ) {
  // Define a custom control class, WP_Customize_Custom_Control.
  // Register the class so that its JS template is available in the Customizer.
  $wp_customize->register_control_type( 'WP_Customize_Custom_Control' );
}
```

All registered control types have their templates printed to the customizer by `WP_Customize_Manager::print_control_templates()`.

## Sending PHP Control Data to JavaScript

While Customizer control data has always been passed to the control JS models, and this has always been able to be extended, you’re much more likely to need to send data down when working with JS templates. Anything that you would want access to in `render_content()` in PHP will need to be exported to JavaScript to be accessible in your control template. `WP_Customize_Control` exports the following control class variables by default:

- `type`
- `label`
- `description`
- `active` (boolean state)

You can add additional parameters specific to your custom control by overriding `<a href="#reference/classes/wp_customize_control/to_json">WP_Customize_Control::to_json()</a>` in your custom control subclass. In most cases, you’ll want to call the parent class’ `to_json()` method also, to ensure that all core variables are exported as well. Here’s an example from the core color control:

```php
public function to_json() {
  parent::to_json();
  $this->json['statuses'] = $this->statuses;
  $this->json['defaultValue'] = $this->setting->default;
}
```

## JS/Underscore Templating

Once you’ve registered your custom control class as a control type and exported any custom class variables, you can create the template that will render the control UI. You’ll override `<a href="#reference/classes/wp_customize_control/content_template">WP_Customize_Control::content_template()</a>` (empty by default) as a replacement for `<a href="#reference/classes/wp_customize_control/render_content">WP_Customize_Control::render_content()</a>`. Render content is still called, so be sure to override it with an empty function in your subclass as well.

Underscore-style custom control templates are very similar to PHP. As more and more of WordPress core becomes JavaScript-driven, these templates are becoming increasingly more common. Some sample template code in core can be found in [media](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/media-template.php), [revisions](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-admin/includes/revision.php#L260), the [theme browser](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-admin/themes.php#L293), and even [in the Twenty Fifteen theme](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/inc/customizer.php#L266), where a JS template is used to both save the color scheme data and instantly preview color scheme changes in the Customizer. The best way to learn how these templates work is to study similar code in core and, accordingly, here is a brief example:

```php
class WP_Customize_Color_Control extends WP_Customize_Control {
  public $type = 'color';
// ...
  /**
   * Render a JS template for the content of the color picker control.
   */
  public function content_template() {
    ?>
    <# var defaultValue = '';
    if ( data.defaultValue ) {
      if ( '#' !== data.defaultValue.substring( 0, 1 ) ) {
        defaultValue = '#' + data.defaultValue;
      } else {
        defaultValue = data.defaultValue;
      }
      defaultValue = ' data-default-color=' + defaultValue; // Quotes added automatically.
    } #>
    <label>
      <# if ( data.label ) { #>
        <span class="customize-control-title">{{{ data.label }}}</span>
      <# } #>
      <# if ( data.description ) { #>
        <span class="description customize-control-description">{{{ data.description }}}</span>
      <# } #>
      <div class="customize-control-content">
        <input class="color-picker-hex" type="text" maxlength="7" placeholder="<?php esc_attr_e( 'Hex Value' ); ?>" {{ defaultValue }} />
      </div>
    </label>
    <?php
  }
}
```

In the above template for the core custom color control, you can see that after the closing PHP tag, we have a JS template. `` notation is used around statements to be evaluated – in most cases, this is used for conditionals. All of the control instance data that we exported to JS is stored in the `data` object, and we can print a variable using double (escaped) or triple (unescaped) brace notation `{{ }}`. As I said before, the best way to get the hang of writing controls like this is to read through existing examples. [`WP_Customize_Upload_Control` ](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/class-wp-customize-control.php#L639)was recently [updated to leverage this API](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/30309) as well, integrating nicely with the way the media manager is implemented, and squeezing a ton of functionality out of a minimal amount of code. If you want some really good practice, try converting some of the other core controls to use this API – and submit patches to core too, of course!

## Putting the pieces together

Here’s a summary of what’s needed to leverage the new API in a custom customizer control subclass:

1. Make your render\_content() function empty (but it does need to exist to override the default one).
2. Create a new function, content\_template(), and put the old contents of render\_content() there.
3. Add any custom class variables that are needed for the control to be exported to the JavaScript in the browser (the JSON data) by modifying the to\_json() function (see [WP\_Customize\_Color\_Control](#reference/classes/wp_customize_color_control) for an example).
4. Convert the PHP from render\_content() into a JS template, using  around JS statements to evaluate and {{ }} around variables to print. PHP class variables are available in the data object; for example, the label can be printed with {{ data.label }}.
5. **Register the custom control class/type**. This critical step tells the Customizer to print the template for this control. This is distinct from just printing templates for all controls that were added because the ideas are that many instances of this control type could be rendered from one template, and that any registered control types would be available for dynamic control-creation in the future. Just do something like $wp\_customize-&gt;register\_control\_type( '[WP\_Customize\_Color\_Control](#reference/classes/wp_customize_color_control)' );.

The PHP-only parts of the Customize API are still fully supported and perfectly fine to use. But given long term goals for making the customizer more flexible for doing things like switching themes in the customizer without a pageload, it is strongly encouraged to use JS/Underscore templates for all custom customizer objects where feasible.

## Allow Non-administrators to Access the Customizer

Customizer access is controlled by the customize meta capability (mapped to edit\_theme\_options by default), which is assigned only to administrators by default. This allows for wider use of the Customizer’s extensive capability-access options, which are built into panels, sections, and settings. Additionally, this makes it possible to allow non-administrators to use the customizer for, for example, customizing posts. This change is an important step toward expanding the scope of the Customizer beyond themes.

```php
<?php
function allow_users_who_can_edit_posts_to_customize( $caps, $cap, $user_id ) {
	$required_cap = 'edit_posts';
	if ( 'customize' === $cap && user_can( $user_id, $required_cap ) ) {
		$caps = array( $required_cap );
	}
	return $caps;
}
add_filter( 'map_meta_cap', 'allow_users_who_can_edit_posts_to_customize', 10, 3 );
```

Note that it is currently necessary to manually add links to the Customizer in the admin menu, admin bar, or elsewhere if you are granting the customize meta capability to non-administrator users.

Conditional Tags are a boolean data type that can be used in your Template Files to alter the display of content depending on the conditions that the current page matches. They tell WordPress what code to display under specific conditions. Conditional Tags usually work with PHP [if](http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.if.php "PHP if conditional") /[else](http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.else.php "PHP else conditional") Conditional Statements and have close relation with WOrdPress [Template Hierarchy](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy "Template Hierarchy"). .

**Warning: You can only use conditional query tags after the [WP\_Query](#reference/classes/wp_query) is set up or with [action hook](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference#Actions_Run_During_a_Typical_Request "Plugin API/Action Reference").**

# Images <a name="themes/functionality/media/images" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/media/images/

## Images

This section describes the handling of images in the Media Library. If you want to display the image file located within your theme directory, just specify the location with the img tag, and style it with CSS. ```
<img alt="" src="" />
```

### Getting img code

To display the image in the Media Library, use `<a href="#reference/functions/wp_get_attachment_image">wp_get_attachment_image()</a>` function.

```php
echo wp_get_attachment_image( $attachment->ID, 'thumbnail' );
```

You will get the following HTML output with the selected thumbnail size

```markup
<img width="150" height="150" src="http://example.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sample-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" ... />
```

You can specify other size such as ‘full’ for original image or ‘medium’ and ‘large’ for the sizes set at **Settings &gt; Media** in the [Administration Screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Screens), or any pair of width and height as array. You’re also free to set custom size strings with [add\_image\_size()](#reference/functions/add_image_size) ;

```php
echo wp_get_attachment_image( $attachment->ID, array(640, 480) );
```

### Getting URL of image

If you want to get the URL of the image, use `<a href="#reference/functions/wp_get_attachment_image_src">wp_get_attachment_image_src()</a>`. It returns an array (URL, width, height, is\_intermediate), or `false`, if no image is available.

```php
<?php 
$image_attributes = wp_get_attachment_image_src( $attachment->ID );
if ( $image_attributes ) : ?>
    <img src="<?php echo $image_attributes[0]; ?>" width="<?php echo $image_attributes[1]; ?>" height="<?php echo $image_attributes[2]; ?>" />
<?php endif; ?>
```

### Alignments

When adding the image in your site, you can specify the image alignment as right, left, center or none. WordPress core automatically adds CSS classes to align the image:

- alignright
- alignleft
- aligncenter
- alignnone

This is the sample output when center align si chosen

```markup
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131" src= ... />
```

In order to take advantage of these CSS classes for alignment and text wrapping, your theme must include the styles in a stylesheet such as the [main stylesheet file](#themes/basics/main-stylesheet-style-css). You can use the `style.css` bundled with official themes such as Twenty Seventeen for reference.

### Caption

If a Caption was specified to image in the Media Library, HTML `img` element was enclosed by the shortcode \[caption\] and \[/caption\].

```markup
<div class="mceTemp">
  <dl id="attachment_133" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1210px">
    <dt class="wp-caption-dt">
      <img class="size-full wp-image-133" src="http://example.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sample.jpg" alt="sun set" width="1200" height="400" />
    </dt>
    <dd class="wp-caption-dd">Sun set over the sea</dd>
  </dl>
</div>
```

And, it will be rendered as in HTML as the figure tag:

```markup
<figure id="attachment_133" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <img class="size-full wp-image-133" src="http://example.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sample.jpg" alt="sun set" width="1200" height="400" srcset= ... />
  <figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Sun set over the sea</figcaption>
</figure>
```

Similar to alignments, your theme must include following styles.

- `wp-caption`
- `wp-caption-text`

## WebP support and default MIME type of sub size image output

[WordPress 5.8](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/07/wordpress-5-8-adds-webp-support/) introduces support for [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) image format which provides improved lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. WebP images are around 30% smaller on average than their JPEG or PNG equivalents, resulting in sites that are faster and use less bandwidth. WebP is supported in all modern browsers [according to caniuse](https://caniuse.com/webp).

When images are uploaded, WordPress generates smaller sub sizes as defined using `add_image_size()`. By default, WordPress will generate these sub sizes in the same format as the original. Because of the performance benefits of the WebP format, it may be desirable for sub sizes to be generated in WebP instead of the original format.

`image_editor_output_format` filter hook can be used to change the file format used for image sub sizes. This can be used to switch all sub sizes to WebP, or any other desired format (JPEG, etc.).

The following example shows how to generate all sub sizes for JPG images using WebP:

```php
<?php
function wporg_image_editor_output_format( $formats ) {
    $formats['image/jpg'] = 'image/webp';
 
    return $formats;
}
add_filter( 'image_editor_output_format', 'wporg_image_editor_output_format' );
```

**Note:** both the GD and ImageMagick libraries support the WebP format in both lossy and lossless. However, only ImageMagick supports animated images.

Setting the output format to WebP will verify if the web server supports it, and if not it will not change the format, i.e. won’t work.

# Audio <a name="themes/functionality/media/audio" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/media/audio/

## Audio

You can directly embed audio files and play them back using a simple shortcode **\[audio\]**. Supported file types are mp3, ogg, wma, m4a and wav. ### Audio shortcode

Following shortcode displays audio player that loads music.mp3 file: ```php
[[audio src="music.mp3"]]
```

To use the shortcode from template file, use do\_shortcode function. When music.mp3 file was stored in (theme\_directory)/sounds directory, insert following code into your template file: ```php
$music_file = get_template_directory_uri() . "/sounds/music.mp3"; 

echo do_shortcode('[[audio mp3=' . $music_file . ']]');
```

The shortcode creates the audio player as shown in the screenshot below. ![Audio player](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/audio_shortcode_basic.jpg?resize=558%2C66&ssl=1)### Loop and Autoplay

The following basic options are supported: #### loop

Allows for the looping of media. - “off” – Do not loop the media. Default.
- “on” – Media will loop to beginning when finished and automatically continue playing.

#### autoplay

Causes the media to automatically play as soon as the media file is ready. - 0 – Do not automatically play the media. Default.
- 1 – Media will play as soon as it is ready.

The following example starts playing music immediately after the page load and loops. ```php
echo do_shortcode('[[audio mp3=' . $music_file . ' loop = "on" autoplay = 1]]');
```

### Styling

If you want to change the look &amp; feel of audio player, you can do so by targeting the default class name of “wp-audio-shortcode”. If you insert following code into your style.css, half width of audio player will be displayed. ```css
.wp-audio-shortcode {

  width: 50%;

}
```

#### Supported Audio format

- mp3
- ogg
- wma
- m4a
- wav

# Video <a name="themes/functionality/media/video" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/media/video/

## Video

The WordPress video feature allows you to embed video files and play them back using a simple shortcode **\[video\]**. Supported file types are mp4, m4v, webm, ogv, wmv and flv.

### Video shortcode

Following shortcode displays video player that loads pepper.mp4 file:

```php
[video src="pepper.mp4"]
```

To use the shortcode in the template file, use the [do\_shortcode()](#reference/functions/do_shortcode) function. If the video file is stored in in your theme directory, get the file url directly using [get\_template\_directory\_uri()](#reference/functions/get_template_directory_uri) or [get\_stylesheet\_uri()](#reference/functions/get_stylesheet_uri) :

```php
$video_file = get_template_directory_uri() . "/videos/pepper.mp4";
echo do_shortcode( '[video mp4=' . $video_file . ']' );
```

The following video player will be loaded.

### Loop and Autoplay

The shortcode video has the same option with audio. Refer to the related section for the [loop and autoplay](#loop-and-autoplay) options.

The following example starts playing the video immediately after the page load and loops:

```php
echo do_shortcode( '[video mp4=' . $video_file . ' loop="on" autoplay=1]' );
```

### Initial image and Styling

The following basic options are supported:

#### Poster

Defines image to show as placeholder before the media plays.  
The following same code takes `album_cover.jpg` stored in `(theme directory)/images` folder as the initial image:

```php
echo do_shortcode( '[video mp4=' . $video_file . ' poster=' . get_template_directory_uri() . '/images/album_cover.jpg]' );
```

#### Height

Defines height of the media. Value is automatically detected on file upload. When you omit this option, the media file height is used.

#### Width

Defines width of the media. Value is automatically detected on file upload. When you omit this option, the media file width is used.

The theme’s content_width sets the maximum width.

The following example will load the audio player with 320 pixels width and 240 pixels height:

```php
echo do_shortcode( '[video mp4=' . $video_file . ' width=320 height=240]' );
```

#### Styling

If you want to change look &amp; feel of video player from stylesheet, you can target the class name of “wp-video-shortcode”. If you want to show the audio player like above in 320 x 240 size, insert following code into your stylesheet:

```css
.wp-video-shortcode {
    height: 240px;
    width: 320px;
}

```

#### Supported Video format

- mp4
- m4v
- webm
- ogv
- flv

## Galleries

[![](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/Capture.png?resize=711%2C583&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/Capture.png?ssl=1)Image galleries are the best way to showcase your pictures on your WordPress sites. WordPress bundles the **Create Gallery** feature by default in the media uploader which allows you to create a simple gallery.

Note: Before adding a gallery, you must have images in your media library. Otherwise, you need to upload the images into the library and can proceed on gallery creation.

### Gallery shortcode

The **Gallery** feature allows you to add one or more image galleries to your posts and pages using a simple Shortcode.

The basic form of gallery shortcode is:

```php
[gallery]
```

  
If you use the [gallery] shortcode without using the `ids` argument in your post or page, only images that are “attached” to that post or page will be displayed.  

If you need to add multiple images with ID’s, use the following sample shortcode

```php
//Note: 10, 205, 552 and 607 are the IDs of respected image.
[gallery ids="10, 205, 552, 607"]
```

  
NOTE: find the proper IDs of the images for the gallery. Go to Media library and click on the respected image and ID will appear on the URL.  

To use the shortcode from the template file, use the [do\_shortcode()](#reference/functions/do_shortcode) function. Insert the following code into your template file:

```php
<?php echo do_shortcode( [gallery] ); ?>
```

If you need to use the shortcode with IDs, insert the following code in your template file:

```php
<?php echo do_shortcode( [gallery ids="10, 205, 552, 607"] ); ?>
```

### Usage

There are may options that may be specified using the below syntax:

```php
[gallery option1="value1" option2="value2"]
```

If you want to print the gallery directly on the template file, use `[do\_shortcode()](#reference/functions/do_shortcode) ` function like below:

```php
<?php echo do_shortcode( '[gallery option1="value1"]' ); ?>
```

If you need to filter the shortcodes, the following example gives you some tips

```php
// Note: 'the_content' filter is used to filter the content of the
// post after it is retrieved from the database and before it is 
// printed to the screen.
<?php
$gallery_shortcode = '[gallery id="' . intval( $post->post_parent ) . '"]';
print apply_filters( 'the_content', $gallery_shortcode );
?>
```

### Supported Options

Gallery Shortcodes supports the basic options which are listed below:

#### Orderby

‘orderby’ specifies the order the thumbnails show up. The default order is ‘menu\_order’.

- menu\_order: You can reorder the images in the Gallery tab of the Add Media popup
- title: Order by the title of the image in the Media Library
- post\_date: Sort by date/time
- rand: Order randomly
- ID: Specify the post ID

#### Order

order specify the sort order used to display thumbnail; ASC or DESC. For Example, to sort by ID and DESC:

```php
[gallery order="DESC" orderby="ID"]
```

If you need to print it on template file, use the [do\_shortcode()](#reference/functions/do_shortcode) function;

```php
<?php echo do_shortcode( '[gallery]' ); ?>
```

#### columns

The Columns options specify the number of columns in the gallery. The default value is 3.  
If you want to increase the number of column in the galley, use the following shortcode.

```php
[gallery columns="4"]
```

If you need to print it on your template file, use the [do\_shortcode()](#reference/functions/do_shortcode) function;

```php
<?php echo do_shortcode(' [gallery columns="4"] '); ?>
```

#### IDs

The IDs option on the gallery shortcode loads images with specific post IDs.

If you want to display the attached image with the specific post ID, follow the following code example.

```php
// Note: remove each space between brackets and 'gallery' and brackets and `123"`.
//Here "123" stands for the post IDs. If you want to display more than
//one ID, separate the IDs by a comma `,`.
[ gallery id="123" ]
```

Use ‘do\_shortcode’ function to print the gallery with IDs on template files like below:

```php
// Note: remove each space between brackets and 'gallery' and brackets and `123"`.
<?php echo do_shortcode(' [ gallery id="123" ] '); ?>
```

#### Size

Size determines the image size to use for the thumbnail display. Valid values include “thumbnail”, “medium”, “large”, “full” and any other additional image size that was registered with [add\_image\_size()](#reference/functions/add_image_size). The default value is “thumbnail”. The size of the images for “thumbnail”, “medium” and “large” can be configured in WordPress admin panel under Settings &gt; Media.

For example, to display a gallery of medium sized images:

```php
[gallery size="medium"]
```

Some advanced options are also available on Gallery shortcodes.

#### itemtag

The name of the HTML tag used to enclose each item in the gallery. The default is “dl”.

#### icontag

The name of the HTMLtag used to enclose each thumbnail icon in the gallery. The default is “dt”.

#### captiontag

The name of the HTML tag used to enclose each caption. The default is “dd”.

You are allowed to change the defaults.

```php
[gallery itemtag="div" icontag="span" captiontag="p"]
```

#### Link

Specify where you want the image to link. The default value links to the attachment’s [permalink](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks). Options:

- file – Link directly to image file
- none – No link

Example:

```php
[gallery link="file"]
```

#### Include

Include allows you to insert an “array” of comma separated attachment IDs to show only the images from these attachments.

```php
[gallery include="23,39,45"]
```

#### Exclude

Exclude callows you to insert an “array” of comma separated attachment IDs to not show the images from these attachments. Please note that include and exclude cannot be used together.

```markup
[gallery exclude="21,32,43"]
```

# Custom Front Page Templates <a name="themes/functionality/custom-front-page-templates" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/custom-front-page-templates/

By default, WordPress shows your most recent posts in reverse chronological order on the front page of your site. Many WordPress users want a static front page or splash page as the front page instead. This “static front page” look is common for users desiring static or welcoming information on the front page of the site.

The look and feel of the front page of the site is based upon the choices of the user combined with the features and options of the WordPress Theme.

## Template Hierarchy of Custom Front Page

On the site front page, WordPress will always use the front-page.php template file, if it exists. If front-page.php does not exist, WordPress will determine which template file to use, depending on the user configuration of [Settings](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Reading "Administration Panels") &gt; [Reading](https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_Reading_SubPanel "Settings Reading SubPanel") &gt;Front page displays, as follows: - **A static page:** WordPress uses the [Static Page](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy#Page_display "Template Hierarchy") template hierarchy: 
    1. [Custom Page Template](https://codex.wordpress.org/Page_Templates#Custom_Page_Template "Page Templates")
    2. page-{id}.php
    3. page-{slug}.php
    4. page.php
    5. index.php
- **Your latest posts:** WordPress uses the [Blog Posts Index](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy#Home_Page_display "Template Hierarchy") template hierarchy: 
    1. home.php
    2. index.php

### Custom Site Front Page Template

To create a custom site front page template, include either of the following in the Theme: - front-page.php
- A [Custom Page Template](https://codex.wordpress.org/Page_Templates#Custom_Page_Template "Page Templates") (e.g. template-featured.php for featured content)

### Custom Blog Posts Index Page Template

To create a custom blog posts index template, include the following in the Theme: - home.php

Use only the home.php template file for the blog posts index. Do not use a Custom Page Template (such as template-blog.php) for two reasons: 1. When the static front page feature is configured properly, WordPress will not use a Custom Page Template to display the blog posts index, even if a Custom Page Template is assigned to the page designated as the “Posts page”. WordPress will *only* use either home.php or index.php.
2. When the Custom Page Template is assigned to a static page other than the one designated as the “Posts page,” the blog posts index loop pagination will not work properly.

## Contextual Conditional Tags

### is\_front\_page

The [Conditional Tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags "Conditional Tags") [is\_front\_page()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/is_front_page) checks if the site front page is being displayed. Returns true when the site front page is being displayed, regardless of whether ‘[Settings](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Reading "Administration Panels") &gt; [Reading](https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_Reading_SubPanel "Settings Reading SubPanel") -&gt;Front page displays’ is set to “Your latest posts” or “A static page”. ### is\_home

The [Conditional Tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags "Conditional Tags") [is\_home()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/is_home) checks if the blog posts index is being displayed. Returns true when the blog posts index is being displayed: when the site front page is being displayed and ‘[Settings](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Reading "Administration Panels") &gt; [Reading](https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_Reading_SubPanel "Settings Reading SubPanel") -&gt;Front page displays’ is set to “Your latest posts”, or when ‘[Settings](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Reading "Administration Panels") &gt; [Reading](https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_Reading_SubPanel "Settings Reading SubPanel") -&gt;Front page displays’ is set to “A static page” and the “Posts Page” value is the current [Page](https://codex.wordpress.org/Pages "Pages") being displayed. When the site front page is being displayed and ‘[Settings](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Reading "Administration Panels") &gt; [Reading](https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_Reading_SubPanel "Settings Reading SubPanel") -&gt;Front page displays’ is set to “Your latest posts”, both[is\_front\_page()](#reference/functions/is_front_page)  and [is\_home()](#reference/functions/is_home)  will return true.

## Configuration of front-page.php

If it exists, the front-page.php template file is used on the site’s front page regardless of whether ‘[Settings](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Reading "Administration Panels") &gt; [Reading](https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_Reading_SubPanel "Settings Reading SubPanel") -&gt;Front page displays’ is set to “A static page” or “Your latest posts,” the Theme will need to account for both options, so that the site front page will display either a static page or the blog posts index. There are a few methods to do so. ### Conditional display within front-page.php

One way to allow front-page.php to account for both options for ‘[Settings](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Reading "Administration Panels") &gt; [Reading](https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_Reading_SubPanel "Settings Reading SubPanel") -&gt;Front page displays’ is to add a conditional inside of front-page.php itself, using [get\_option( 'show\_on\_front' )](https://codex.wordpress.org/Option_Reference#Reading "Option Reference"), [get\_home\_template()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_home_template "Function Reference/get home template"), and[get\_page\_template()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_page_template "Function Reference/get page template"). Method 1: including custom content directly within front-page.php: ```php
if ( 'posts' == get_option( 'show_on_front' ) ) {

    include( get_home_template() );

} else {

    // Custom content markup goes here

}
```

Method 2: including any page template: ```php
if ( 'posts' == get_option( 'show_on_front' ) ) {

    include( get_home_template() );

} else {

    include( get_page_template() );

}
```

### Filtering frontpage\_template

Another way to allow the site front page to display either a static page/custom content or the blog posts index, without adding conditional code within front-page.php, is to [filter frontpage\_template](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_query_template "Function Reference/get query template"), by adding a filter callback to functions.php: ```php
function themeslug_filter_front_page_template( $template ) {

    return is_home() ? '' : $template;

}

add_filter( 'frontpage_template', 'themeslug_filter_front_page_template' );
```

This method causes WordPress to bypass the front-page.php template file altogether when the blog posts index is being displayed. ## Adding custom query loops to front-page.php

If the front-page.php template file includes a default [WordPress Loop](https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop "The Loop"), like so: ```php
&lt;?php

if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();

    // do something

endwhile; else:

    // no posts found

endif;
```

That loop applies to the post content of the static page assigned to ‘[Settings](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Reading "Administration Panels") &gt; [Reading](https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_Reading_SubPanel "Settings Reading SubPanel") -&gt;Posts page’. To display custom loops (latest blog posts, custom/featured content, etc.), add secondary loop queries using calls to [WP\_Query](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query "Class Reference/WP Query"). For example, to show the 3 latest blog posts: ```php
$latest_blog_posts = new WP_Query( array( 'posts_per_page' =&gt; 3 ) );

if ( $latest_blog_posts-&gt;have_posts() ) : while ( $latest_blog_posts-&gt;have_posts() ) : $latest_blog_posts-&gt;the_post();

    // Loop output goes here

endwhile; endif;
```

## Pagination

Static front pages are not intended to be paged. None of the WordPress [Previous / Next page link](https://codex.wordpress.org/Next_and_Previous_Links "Next and Previous Links") functions work with a static front page. Pagination on a static front page uses the page query variable, not the paged variable. See the [WP\_Query](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query "Class Reference/WP Query") for details.

# Custom Backgrounds <a name="themes/functionality/custom-backgrounds" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/custom-backgrounds/

Custom Backgrounds is a theme feature that provides for customization of the background color and image.  
Theme developer needs 2 steps to implement it.

1. Enable Custom Background – [add\_theme\_support()](#reference/functions/add_theme_support)
2. Display Custom Background – [wp\_head()](#reference/functions/wp_head) and [body\_class()](#reference/functions/body_class)

## Enable Custom Backgrounds

Use [add\_theme\_support()](#reference/functions/add_theme_support) in the `functions.php` file to enable custom backgrounds.

```php
add_theme_support( 'custom-background' );
```

  
You can specify default parameters. In below example using default ‘#0000ff’ background color (blue) with ‘wapuu.jpg’ background image that was stored under the /images folder.

```php
$args = array(
    'default-color' => '0000ff',
    'default-image' => get_template_directory_uri() . '/images/wapuu.jpg',
);
add_theme_support( 'custom-background', $args );
```

  
By calling [add\_theme\_support()](#reference/functions/add_theme_support) , Customizer displays ‘Background Image’ menu and ‘Background Color’ section in Colors menu.

## Display Custom Backgrounds

In general, invokes [wp\_head()](#reference/functions/wp_head) and [body\_class()](#reference/functions/body_class) in `header.php` file to display the custom backgrounds.

```php

<html>
<head>
    <?php wp_head(); ?>
</head>
<body <?php body_class(); ?>>
```

[wp\_head()](#reference/functions/wp_head) generates an extra style sheet in-line with the HTML headers, usually right before the end of the document’s HEAD element. The extra style sheet overrides the background values from the theme’s style sheet.  
In our example, following code will be generated in the HTML. Notice that body tag includes “custom-background ” class.

```php

<html lang="en-US" class="no-js">

<head>
	...
<style type="text/css" id="custom-background-css">
body.custom-background {
  background-image: url("http://example.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/my-first-theme/images/wapuu.jpg");
  background-position: left top;
  background-size: auto;
  background-repeat: repeat;
  background-attachment: scroll;
}
</style>
	...
</head>

<body class="home page-template-default page page-id-211 logged-in admin-bar no-customize-support custom-background">

	...
```

Now you’ll see repeated background images

![](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2017/03/custom_background_1.jpg?resize=733%2C302&ssl=1)## Another default example

This is another example of default value set.

```php
$another_args = array(
    'default-color'      => '0000ff',
    'default-image'      => get_template_directory_uri() . '/images/wapuu.jpg',
    'default-position-x' => 'right',
    'default-position-y' => 'top',
    'default-repeat'     => 'no-repeat',
);
add_theme_support( 'custom-background', $another_args );
```

  
This will show single image at the top right corner as below.

![](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2017/03/custom_background_2.jpg?resize=735%2C310&ssl=1)

 Even if we specified the ‘default-color’ as ‘#0000ff’ (blue), the background color is not blue. Setting the default-image parameter will instantly cause that value to become the effective Custom Background, whereas setting the default-color has no effect. It is just set as default background color in Color menu of Customizer, and enhanced when Administrator save it. ![](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2017/03/custom_background_3.jpg?resize=520%2C486&ssl=1)

# Theme Handbook <a name="themes" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/

*Welcome to the WordPress Theme Developer Handbook, your resource for learning all about the exciting world of WordPress themes.*

The Theme Developer Handbook is a repository for all things WordPress themes. Whether you’re new to WordPress themes, or you’re an experienced theme developer, you should be able to find the answer to many of your theme-related questions right here.

In this handbook, you can learn how to build **block themes or classic themes.**

- A block theme is a new theme that you can use from WordPress version 5.9. It is built mainly using HTML and a theme configuration file. The block theme is composed entirely of blocks, allowing you to edit all parts of your site in the Site Editor.
- A classic theme is the original theme, without version limitations, that primarily uses PHP, JavaScript and CSS. Classic themes take advantage of WordPress PHP functions, hooks and filters.

1. If you’re new to developing WordPress themes, start with section 1, where you can [find out what a theme is](#theme/getting-started/what-is-a-theme), learn about [WordPress’ license](https://wordpress.org/about/license/), and [set up your development environment](#themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup).
2. Once you’re through the introduction, continue with the [Core Concepts](#themes/core-concepts) section.

It is recommended to read through both the block theme section and the classic theme sections. This will give you an understanding of the differences between the two types of themes, and help you choose what type of theme to build.

If you’ve got to grips with the basics of themes, check out the [Advanced Theme Topics](#theme/advanced-topics) to learn about child themes, best UI practices, theme testing and more.

Once you’ve got your theme ready for the world, the final section will cover [releasing your theme](#themes/releasing-your-theme), teaching you some best practices for theme distribution, and for getting it ready for the WordPress.org theme directory.

# What Is a Theme? <a name="themes/getting-started/what-is-a-theme" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/what-is-a-theme/

A WordPress theme represents the design of your website. It can control everything from colors, to fonts, to the entire layout. In essence, what you see when viewing the front-end of your site is shaped by the theme.

[![A collage of site designs at an angle.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/twenty-twenty-two-collage.jpg?resize=2400%2C1500&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/twenty-twenty-two-collage.jpg?ssl=1)Templates from the default Twenty Twenty-Two theme.There are 1,000s of free WordPress themes in the [WordPress.org Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/) and even more from third-party directories and shops. Many people and businesses also have bespoke (custom-made) themes for their sites.

## What can themes do?

Themes take the content stored by WordPress and display it in the browser. When you create a WordPress theme, you decide how that content looks and is displayed. There are many options available to you when building your theme. The biggest limit is your imagination.

As a theme creator, you can:

- Create different layouts, such as one, two or more columns.
- Control the typography of the site with custom font choices.
- Skin the site with any color scheme you want.
- Put a sidebar on the left or right side of the page. Or, have no sidebar at all.
- Display featured images alongside posts.

[![The WordPress site editor showing the homepage template with a dotted black background and a three-column grid of posts.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/twenty-twenty-three-style-variation.jpg?resize=2400%2C1255&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/twenty-twenty-three-style-variation.jpg?ssl=1)Editing a Twenty Twenty-Three theme style variation.The WordPress theming system is incredibly powerful. As with every web design project, a good theme is more than defining a layout or two and a few custom colors. The best themes improve engagement with a website’s content *in addition* to being beautiful.

There really are not many limits to the possibilities. Outside of your imagination, theme creation requires some baseline knowledge, which is covered in the [Reading this handbook](#themes/getting-started/reading-this-handbook) page of this chapter. That’s what this handbook is all about—*teaching you what you need to know to build themes of your own*.

## Theme types

WordPress supports two primary types of themes: **block** and **classic**.

There is also a classic subtype that is called a **hybrid** theme, and you’ll learn about it below, too. But the most important distinction is block vs. classic.

Technically, you can even build your own theming system altogether. That’s outside the scope of this handbook, but it’s at least worth noting that WordPress lets you build pretty much whatever you set your mind to.

### Block themes

Block themes are the modern method of building WordPress themes. They generally follow a standard set of conventions and are built entirely out of blocks. This handbook will primarily focus on building themes using this method because it is the future of the WordPress project.

Block themes rely on HTML-based [block templates](#themes/templates) that contain block markup. Both creators and users can edit the templates in the Site Editor. Users can also customize [global settings and styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles) defined by the theme’s `theme.json` file through the Styles interface.

It’s also possible to export a theme directly from the Site Editor without touching any code. Technically, you cannot create a new theme from scratch entirely from the editor, but you can modify the templates and styles of an existing theme—in essence, creating a custom theme of your own.

[![WordPress site editor with a single post template that shows a design with a yellow background and black text.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/site-editor-styles.png?resize=2400%2C1255&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/site-editor-styles.png?ssl=1)Editing a theme’s styles in the Site Editor.### Classic themes

Classic themes use a PHP-based templating system, which is still supported in WordPress today. They are still in wide use because they were built on the theming system that was first introduced in 2005 with the launch of [WordPress 1.5](https://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/strayhorn/). There is a long and deep history of classic theming in WordPress, which continues on. For this reason, the handbook maintains documentation for classic themes in the [Classic Themes](#themes/classic-themes) chapter.

Unlike block themes, classic themes have far fewer standards to adhere to, but there are APIs you can use for specific features. The classic theme creation process also requires some minimal PHP, HTML, and CSS code knowledge, at least.

[![WordPress customizer showing the Twenty Twenty-Two theme. On the left is a list of options, and on the right a preview of the site homepage.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/customizer-twenty-twenty.jpg?resize=2400%2C1255&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/customizer-twenty-twenty.jpg?ssl=1)Editing the default Twenty Twenty theme styles in the customizer.### Hybrid themes

Hybrid themes are merely classic themes that have adopted some modern block-related features, such as [global settings and styles](#themes/global-settings-and-styles) or [block template parts](#themes/templatestemplate-parts/). This is a widely agreed-upon term by the community, but it is not an “official” theme type. At the end of the day, hybrids are still classic themes.

## Become familiar with themes

To build a WordPress theme of your own, you should familiarize yourself with how themes work from a user’s viewpoint. Before diving into the creation process, try [installing a theme](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/work-with-themes/) and playing around with it.

WordPress comes with several default themes, titled *Twenty \[Year\]*, but you should also try other themes from the [Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/) just to get a feel for the possibilities.

## What are themes made of?

Themes can include many different folders and file types. The list below is non-exhaustive, but it includes some of common things you might see:

- Templates (`.html` in block themes and `.php` in classic themes)
- CSS Stylesheets
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Media (images, audio, video, etc.)
- JSON

You will learn more about the specific folders and files used to create a theme in the next chapter: [Core Concepts](#themes/core-concepts).

## What is the difference between themes and plugins?

It is common for there to be overlap between features found in themes and plugins. However, best practices are:

- Themes control the *presentation* of content.
- Plugins control the behaviors and features of your site.

Any theme that you create should not add site-critical functionality. Doing so means that a user loses access to that functionality when they change their theme.

For example, say you build a theme with a portfolio feature. Users who build their portfolio with your feature will lose it when they change themes. By leaving critical features to plugins, you make it possible to change the design of a website while its features remain intact.

Remember, some users switch themes often. It is best practice to make sure any functionality their sites require, even if the design changes, is in a separate plugin.

## Block Theme

This section is for a [block theme](#themes/block-themes).

### Required Files

The *only* files needed for a block theme is,

- **index.html**, which is the main template to display your list of posts. Index.html needs to be placed inside a folder called templates.
- **style.css** file to style content.
- **theme.json** file to set style properties in a structured way.

[![Required Files Block Theme](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2022/11/required-files-block-themes.png?resize=1024%2C158&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2022/11/required-files-block-themes.png?ssl=1)For advanced block theme development, you can add templates and template parts. For example,

1. You can create a templates directory inside the theme folder and put your templates there. Templates examples, 
    - index.html
    - archive.html
    - single.html
    - page.html
2. You can create a parts directory inside the theme folder and put template parts. Template parts examples, 
    - header.html
    - footer.html
    - sidebar.html

[![](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2022/11/my-first-fse-theme.png?resize=389%2C425&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2022/11/my-first-fse-theme.png?ssl=1)As you know the required files for block themes, now let’s create your first block theme.

### Step 1 – Create a theme folder

First, create a new folder on your computer, and name it **my-first-theme**. This is where all of your theme’s files will go.

### Step 2 – Create a style.css file

You can use any basic text editor on your computer to create a new file called **style.css**.

If you’re on a Windows-based machine use Notepad for now and if you’re using a Mac then use TextEdit.

Copy and paste the following code into your newly created **style.css** file:

/\*  
Theme Name: My First WordPress Theme  
\*/

### Step 3 – Create a theme.json file

Create the theme.json file in the root folder, and copy and paste the following code:

{  
 “version”: 2,  
 “settings”: {  
 “layout”: {  
 “contentSize”: “840px”,  
 “wideSize”: “1100px”  
 }  
 }  
}

### Step 4 – Add index.html inside the templates folder

Inside your theme directory, create a templates folder. Inside the templates folder creates an **index.html** file.

Now, your theme structure should look like this,

templates/

 index.html

style.css

theme.json

Your block theme is now ready. You can install and activate the theme. First, make the ZIP file of your theme directory. The ZIP file will be like, **my-first-theme.zip**

### Step 5 – Install and activate your theme

Now, go to your WordPress admin panel and **Appearance &gt; Themes &gt; Add New &gt; Upload**. Upload the my-first-theme.zip and click on install and then activate.

Congratulations – you’ve made your first WordPress block theme.

To know more about block themes, you can download the default Twenty Twenty-Three theme and use it as a reference.

## Classic Theme

![getting-started-your-first-theme-01](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/07/getting-started-your-first-theme-01.jpg?resize=1731%2C649&ssl=1)### Required Files

As mentioned earlier in the “[What is a Theme](#themes/getting-started/what-is-a-theme)” section, the *only* files needed for a WordPress theme to work out of the box are an `index.php` file to display your list of posts and a `style.css` file to style the content.

Once you get into more advanced development territory and your themes grow in size and complexity, you’ll find it easier to break your theme into many separate files (called [template files](#themes/basics/template-files "Template Files")) instead. For example, most WordPress themes will also include:

- `header.php`
- `index.php`
- `sidebar.php`
- `footer.php`

We will cover creating separate files later in this handbook, but for now let’s get your first theme launched!

(Note: The following steps assume you have already completed the “[Setting up a Development Environment](#themes/getting-started/setting-up-a-development-environment "Setting up a Development Environment")” section.)

### Step 1 – Create a theme folder

First, create a new folder on your computer, and name it *my-first-theme*. This is where all of your theme’s files will go.

### Step 2 – Create a style.css file

You can use any basic text editor on your computer to create a new file called style.css.

If you’re on a Windows-based machine use [Notepad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_(software)) for now and if you’re using a Mac then use [TextEdit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit).

Copy and paste the following code into your newly created `style.css` file:

```php
/*
Theme Name: My First WordPress Theme
*/

body {
background: #21759b;
}
```

[Reference Gist](https://gist.github.com/philiparthurmoore/0496a9b659c12280666d)

### Step 3 – Create an index.php file

Now create a file named `index.php` and put it into your theme’s folder, adding the following code to it:

```php

<html>
<head>
<meta charset="<?php bloginfo( 'charset' ); ?>">
<title><?php wp_title( '|', true, 'right' ); ?></title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo esc_url( get_stylesheet_uri() ); ?>" type="text/css" />
<?php wp_head(); ?>
</head>
<body>
<h1><?php bloginfo( 'name' ); ?></h1>
<h2><?php bloginfo( 'description' ); ?></h2>

<?php if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>

<h3><?php the_title(); ?></h3>

<?php the_content(); ?>
<?php wp_link_pages(); ?>
<?php edit_post_link(); ?>

<?php endwhile; ?>

<?php
if ( get_next_posts_link() ) {
next_posts_link();
}
?>
<?php
if ( get_previous_posts_link() ) {
previous_posts_link();
}
?>

<?php else: ?>

<p>No posts found. :(</p>

<?php endif; ?>
<?php wp_footer(); ?>
</body>
</html>
```

[Reference Gist](https://gist.github.com/philiparthurmoore/b1f47c15d3eb2c573924)

### Step 4 – Install Your Theme

Copy your new theme into the `wp-content/themes` folder on your development environment and activate it for review and testing.

### Step 5 – Activate Your Theme

Now that you’ve installed your theme, go to **Admin &gt; Appearance &gt; Themes** to activate it.

![getting-started-your-first-theme-02](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/07/getting-started-your-first-theme-02.png?resize=1024%2C616&ssl=1)### Using Your First Theme

**Congratulations – you’ve just made your first WordPress theme!**

If you activate your new theme and view it within a browser, you should see something like this:

![Here's how Your First Theme looks on the front end.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/07/getting-started-your-first-theme-03.png?resize=908%2C321&ssl=1)Here’s how Your First Theme looks on the front end.Okay, so it’s not the *prettiest* theme yet, but it’s a terrific start!

## What have we learned?

Although your first theme may be missing the functionality and design elements that are found in other themes, the basic building blocks of a WordPress theme, as we have just created above, are all the same.

Remember that the key here is *not* to get caught up in how all those other things are done *now*, but to understand the guiding principles behind making WordPress themes that will stand the test of time, no matter how the code changes or the template file structure changes over time.

All websites, regardless of how they are created underneath the hood, need common elements: headers, primary content areas, menus, sidebars, footers, and the like. You’ll find that making WordPress themes is really just another way of crafting a website.

From this most basic theme, you’ll start learning about the building blocks that you put together to create a more complex theme.

## Up Next

In [Chapter 2: Theme Basics](#themes/basics "Chapter 2: Theme Basics"), we’ll dive further into themes and discuss the templates and other files that make up most themes, along with the PHP used to make dynamic themes, including:

- Template Tags
- The Loop
- Theme Functions
- Conditional Tags
- and more

# Releasing Your Theme <a name="themes/releasing-your-theme" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/releasing-your-theme/

This section covers the requirements and submission process for releasing your theme into the [WordPress Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/). If you’ve followed the instructions in this handbook, your theme is almost ready for release into the directory.

The first requirement to releasing your theme is to make sure you have – at a minimum – the [required theme files](#themes/release/required-theme-files) before submitting your theme for review.

Once you’ve confirmed the required theme files, thorough [testing](#themes/release/testing) of the theme – including content – must be completed. Following the [theme review guidelines](#themes/release/theme-review-guidelines) will help ensure acceptance of your theme.

After completing everything above, having the proper [documentation](#themes/release/writing-documentation) is the final step before [submitting your theme for approval](#themes/release/submitting-your-theme-to-wordpress-org). After submitting your theme for review, the theme reviewer may request other changes to your theme.

## Important Notices

Themes that have **3 or more distinct issues may be closed** as not-approved. Theme authors are encouraged to review the [Theme Review Guidelines](#themes/release/theme-review-guidelines).

  
[“How to do a review (Draft)”](//make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/how-to-do-a-review-draft/) is another practical guide to understand the review process in-depth.  

## First Two Checks

### **1. Commonly missed requirements**

Here are some of the commonly missed requirements at the initial review. Themes with incomplete requirements may be closed as not-approved.

- Themes must be compatible with the GNU General Public License. GPLv2 or later is strongly recommended.
- Themes are not allowed to include plugins and non-design related functionalities such as forms. Anything that will be deleted when user switches a theme should not be included.
- Shortcodes, custom post types, and custom blocks are not allowed in themes.

### 2. **Testing your theme with Theme Check Plugin**

Theme Check plugin is an easy way to test your theme and ensure it’s up to spec with the latest theme review standards. Learn more about [Theme Check Plugin](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/theme-check-plugin/).

# Organizing Theme Files <a name="themes/basics/organizing-theme-files" />

Source: https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/organizing-theme-files/

While WordPress themes technically only require two files (`index.php` in classic themes and `index.html` in block themes, and `style.css`), they usually are made up of many files. That means they can quickly become disorganized! This section will show you how to keep your files organized.

## Theme folder and file structure

As mentioned previously, the default Twenty themes are some of the best examples of good theme development. For instance, here is how the [Twenty Seventeen Theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/) organizes its [file structure](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen):

```
.
├── assets (dir)/
│   ├── css (dir)
│   ├── images (dir)
│   └── js (dir)
├── inc (dir)
├── template-parts (dir)/
│   ├── footer (dir)
│   ├── header (dir)
│   ├── navigation (dir)
│   ├── page (dir)
│   └── post (dir)
├── 404.php
├── archive.php
├── comments.php
├── footer.php
├── front-page.php
├── functions.php
├── header.php
├── index.php
├── page.php
├── README.txt
├── rtl.css
├── screenshot.png
├── search.php
├── searchform.php
├── sidebar.php
├── single.php
└── style.css
```

You can see that the main theme template files are in the root directory, while JavaScript, CSS, images are placed in assets directory, template-parts are placed in under respective subdirectory of template-parts and collection of functions related to core functionalities are placed in inc directory.

There are no required folders in classic themes. In block themes, templates must be placed inside a folder called **templates**, and all template parts must be placed inside a folder called **parts**.

`style.css` should reside in the root directory of your theme not within the CSS directory.

### Languages folder

It’s best practice to [internationalize your theme](#themes/functionality/internationalization "Internationalization") so it can be translated into other languages. Default themes include the `languages` folder, which contains a .pot file for translation and any translated .mo files. While `languages` is the default name of this folder, you can change the name. If you do so, you must update `<a href="#reference/functions/load_theme_textdomain">load_theme_textdomain()</a>`.
