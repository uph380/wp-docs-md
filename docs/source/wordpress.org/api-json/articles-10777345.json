When you activate comments on a <a href=\"/support/article/pages/\">Page</a> or post, WordPress inserts several text boxes after your content where users can submit their comments. Once you approve a comment, it appears underneath your content. Whether you want to customize how you receive comments or tweak how your site displays comments, WordPress provides a thorough set of options to build a community from the visitors to your site.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Comment screen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All comments on a WordPress website are displayed on the&nbsp;<strong>Comments</strong>&nbsp;dashboard in your WordPress admin area. It displays all comments by default</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1081\" height=\"604\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comments-dashboard.png?fit=1024%2C572&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Comments dashboard\" class=\"wp-image-12717505\" srcset=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comments-dashboard.png 1081w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comments-dashboard-300x168.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comments-dashboard-1024x572.png 1024w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comments-dashboard-768x429.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1081px) 100vw, 1081px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can switch the view to see Pending, Approved, Spam, and Trash comments:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pending:</strong>&nbsp;comments submitted by your visitors, but won\u2019t be visible on your blog posts unless you approve them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Approved:</strong>&nbsp;comments published and are publicly visible on your blog posts by all your website visitors.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Spam</strong>:&nbsp;comments flagged as possibly unwanted or irrelevant, and aren\u2019t visible to your site visitors.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trash</strong>:\u00a0comments marked as unwanted and will be automatically deleted for good after 30 days.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving your mouse over to a comment will display the action links for it. You can approve a comment to make it visible to all your site visitors, or unapprove it to put it in pending status again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also reply to comments. By replying to a specific comment, your reply will appear right under that comment. This is called \u201cthreaded\u201d or \u201cnested\u201d comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also choose to edit anyone\u2019s comments on your own site. The\u00a0<strong>Quick Edit</strong>\u00a0option opens a text area so you can edit the comment without reloading the page.\u00a0<strong>Edit</strong>, on the other hand, gives you more options to edit the name, user email, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a visitor submits his or her comment, WordPress follows your preferences and either hold the comment for your approval or posts it immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you see a comment marked as spam that\u2019s actually a real comment, then you can mark it as\u00a0<strong>Not Spam</strong>\u00a0by hovering your mouse over it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments in the trash section are comments that have been deleted by you. Any comment in the trash can be restored by clicking on\u00a0<strong>Restore</strong>. Comments in trash remain there for 30 days after this time WordPress deletes them permanently.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Discussion settings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you enable comments on posts or <a href=\"/support/article/pages/\">Pages</a>, reviewing the options under <a href=\"/support/article/settings-general-screen/\">Settings</a>  &gt; <a href=\"/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/\">Discussion</a> can help make your life as a moderator easier. Use these settings to restrict comments and reduce the amount of spam you receive.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Notification</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"869\" height=\"210\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/default-post-settings.png\" alt=\"Settings &gt; Discussion &gt; Default post settings.\npage sample image\" class=\"wp-image-12723227\" srcset=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/default-post-settings.png 869w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/default-post-settings-300x72.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/default-post-settings-768x186.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you link another site post on your site, <strong>Attempt to notify any blogs linked to from the post</strong> will enable your site to notify the website owners that you have linked to them.

A reply to a comment is shown &#8220;nested&#8221; underneath the original comments. You can limit how many levels (a reply to a reply) of replies your site will allow by changing the number of levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Break comments into Pages with _____top level comments per Page and the _____ Page displayed by default</strong> will change how your comments are displayed. You can set how many comments you see per Page and if the oldest or newest comments are displayed first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Comments should be displayed with the _____ comments at the top of each Page</strong> will place newer or older comments at the top of each page.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"862\" height=\"195\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comment-administration.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12723283\" srcset=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comment-administration.png 862w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comment-administration-300x68.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comment-administration-768x174.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Comment administration</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Email me whenever \u2026 Anyone posts a comment</strong> and/or <strong>A comment is held for moderation</strong> will help you stay up to date on your comments.

As a result, many spam comments contain multiple links. Setting this option to hold all comments that contain 2 or more links will help catch more spam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can experiment with <strong>Comment Moderation and Comment Blacklist</strong> to catch spam that contains certain words or is posted from a particular IP address. Comments caught through blacklisting are not deleted but instead <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/comment-moderation/\">moved to your spam folder</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because spam is pervasive on the Web, some of the comments you receive will most likely be spam. However, WordPress developers and administrators have already developed a number of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/faq-working-with-wordpress/#what-can-i-do-to-stop-comment-spam\">successful strategies to help you prevent spam comments</a> from appearing on your site. In addition to experimenting with different options in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-general-screen/\">Settings</a> &gt;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-discussion-screen/\"> Discussion</a>, you can install a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\">WordPress Plugin</a> like <a href=\"http://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a> or <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam\">make other changes</a> to help you keep spam comments under control.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Avatars</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The settings under &#8220;Avatars&#8221; control the images your site displays next to comments. For an introduction to Gravatars, read the WordPress Lesson about <a href=\"/support/article/how-to-use-gravatars/\"> How to Use Gravatars in WordPress</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enabling comments on your site</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have decided on your discussion options, you are ready to enable comments.
