(And they save a bit of space as well: a win-win.)</p>\n<h4>TWO: Cut phrases that inflate your word count without actually adding meaning.</h4>\n<p>This happens frequently in two specific instances. First, when writing in the passive voice:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  This block can be used to display single images.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Any time you see phrases like \u201ccan be\u201d or \u201cis used\u201d: halt. You\u2019re writing in the passive voice. Try going active for a snappier (and shorter) sentence:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  This block displays single images.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Second, this happens when we hedge instead of making declarative statements:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The gallery block can help you display multiple images in an elegant layout.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Does it or doesn\u2019t it? We\u2019re making this software: we\u2019re allowed to be declarative about what it is and does:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The gallery block displays multiple images in an elegant layout.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>We also all do this a lot with the phrase \u201callows you to.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Preformatted text allows you to keep your tabs and line breaks.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Features don\u2019t allow anyone to do anything; they\u2019re just tools that do specific things to achieve an end. Just say what they do:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Preformatted text preserves your tabs and line breaks.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The more direct sentences are almost always clearer. Scan your copy for the words \u201ccan,\u201d \u201cbe,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d \u201callows you to,\u201d and \u201chelps\u201d\u2014they\u2019re the most common culprits, and looking for those words specifically is a way to locate phrasing you can tighten up.</p>\n<h4>THREE: Beware of \u201csimple,\u201d \u201ceasy,\u201d and \u201cjust.\u201d</h4>\n<p>It is not for us to decide what is simple: it\u2019s for the user to decide. If we say something is easy and the user doesn\u2019t have an easy experience, it undermines their trust in us and what we\u2019re building. The same goes for \u201cjust\u201d\u2014many of us know to avoid \u201csimple,\u201d but still use \u201cjust\u201d all the time. \u201cJust click here.\u201d \u201cJust enter your username.\u201d It\u2019s the same thing: it implies that something will be no big deal, but we can\u2019t know what the user will find to be a big deal.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also safer and more helpful to be specific. \u201cEasy\u201d and \u201csimple\u201d are shorthand for explanations that we haven\u2019t written; whenever you see them, take a minute to think about what they\u2019re standing in for. Maybe \u201cIt\u2019s easy to add a block by hitting \u2018enter\u2019\u201d really means \u201cYou can add more content to the page without taking your hands off the keyboard.\u201d Great! Say the specific thing instead of relying on \u201ceasy.\u201d</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t to say that you should banish these words from your vocabulary. You might want to write a tooltip describing how the cover image block now requires less configuration, or an email about how we\u2019re building a tool for quick creation of custom blocks, and you could legitimately say that the cover image block has been simplified or that we\u2019re working to make custom block creation easier\u2014there, the terms are descriptive and relative. But be on the lookout for ways you might be using (or overusing) them to make absolute claims that something is easy or simple, and use those as opportunities to be more specific and clear.</p>\n<h4>FOUR: Look out for \u201cwe.\u201d</h4>\n<p>Any time text or instructions uses \u201cwe\u201d a lot, it means the focus of the text is on the people behind the software and not the people using the software. Sometimes that\u2019s what you actually want\u2014but it\u2019s usually not. The focus should typically be on the user, what they need, and how they benefit rather than \u201cwhat we did\u201d or \u201cwhat we want.\u201d</p>\n<p>We\u2019re the only ones that care about what we did or want; the user just wants software that works. If you see a lot of \u201cwe\u201ds, think about whether you should reframe what you\u2019re writing to focus on the benefits to and successes of the user.</p>\n<h2>Bulleted Lists</h2>\n<p>Guidelines for (duh) writing bulleted lists.</p>\n<h4>ONE: Keep sentence structures parallel across all bullets.</h4>\n<p>Parallel structure makes lists easier to read quickly\u2014their predictability takes some cognitive load off the reader.</p>\n<p>GOOD:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What can you do with this block? Lots of things!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a quote.</li>\n<li>Highlight a link.</li>\n<li>Display multiple images.</li>\n<li>Create a bulleted list.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every bullet is a full sentence, and ends with a period. (If your list is a bunch of one- or two-word items, those can often just turn into a single regular sentence\u2014easier to read, and space-saving.) Every line begins with a verb that tells the user what the block can do. The subject of the sentence is always the user.</p>\n<p>A user can absorb this list quickly because once they read the first item, they understand how to read the rest and know what information they\u2019ll find.</p>\n<p>LESS GOOD:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What can you do with this block? Lots of things!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can add a quote.</li>\n<li>Highlighting a link you love.</li>\n<li>It displays multiple images. Nice for galleries!</li>\n<li>Bulleted lists</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here, every line has different phrasing (some start with a verb, some with a noun) and the subject of the sentence changes (sometimes it\u2019s you, sometimes it\u2019s the block). Some lines have added description, some don&#8217;t. There\u2019s an incomplete sentence, and punctuation is inconsistent.</p>\n<p>Reading this list takes more work because the reader has to parse each bullet anew. They can\u2019t assume each bullet will contain similar information.</p>\n<p>Note: this doesn&#8217;t mean every bullet has to be super short and start with an action verb! \u201cPredictable\u201d doesn\u2019t have to mean \u201csimple.\u201d It just means that each bullet should have the same sentence structure. This list would also be fine:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What can you do with this block? Lots of things!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try adding a quote. Sometimes someone else said things best!</li>\n<li>Use it to highlight a link you love\u2014sharing links is the currency of the internet.</li>\n<li>Create a gallery that displays multiple images, and show off your best photos.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here, each bullet starts with a more user-focused verb and includes a piece of supplemental information for more interest. The punctuation varies a bit, which keeps the lines from feeling too formulaic, but since the basic structure of each is the same, they remain easy to read.</p>\n<h4>TWO: When in doubt, start with a verb. (But not always the same verb.)</h4>\n<p>Do you have to start with a verb? No. But if you\u2019re at a loss, you usually can\u2019t go wrong with a verb (especially since bulleted lists are often describing a series of actions or possible actions).</p>\n<p>In a simple list that\u2019s meant to be purely instructional (e.g., in UI copy where you just need the user to make a decision), it might be fine to start every bullet with the same verb:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  To continue, choose an action:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a simple text block.</li>\n<li>Add a pullquote block.</li>\n<li>Add an image block.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If your list is more persuasive (e.g., trying to convince someone to use a feature by listing its benefits) or includes multi-step instructions, you\u2019ll want to vary your verbs to keep the reader engaged with more interesting language, as in the example above:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What can you do with this block? Lots of things!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try adding a quote. Sometimes someone else said things best!</li>\n<li>Use it to highlight a link you love\u2014sharing links is the currency of the internet.</li>\n<li>Create a gallery that displays multiple images, and show off your best photos.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These aren\u2019t hard-and-fast rules\u2014you might choose the use the same verb in a persuasive list to be more focused and powerful, for example. But they\u2019re good starting places for solid lists.</p>\n<h4>THREE: When something&#8217;s clearly a list, you don&#8217;t have to tell us it&#8217;s a list.</h4>\n<p>GOOD:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What can you do with this block? Lots of things!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a quote.</li>\n<li>Highlight a link you love.</li>\n<li>Display multiple images.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>LESS GOOD:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What can you do with this block? Lots of things! Here are some examples of ways you can use it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can add a quote.</li>\n<li>Highlighting a link you love.</li>\n<li>It displays multiple images. Nice for galleries!</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Find the balance between being as clear as possible and trusting a user. On one hand, we know that people don\u2019t always read instructions; on the other, redundancy can make the user feel like we think they\u2019re stupid.</p>\n<h4>FOUR: Bold is sometimes your friend.</h4>\n<p>Use it to focus readers on the key information in a bulleted list. This is especially useful when your bullets include some supplemental but ultimately secondary information.</p>\n<p>\u201cKey information\u201d is, well, key: bold draws the eye, so stick to the most vital piece of information in a given bullet:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What can you do with this block? Lots of things!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try adding a <strong>quote</strong>. Sometimes someone else said things best!</li>\n<li>Use it to highlight a <strong>link</strong> you love\u2014sharing links is the currency of the internet.</li>\n<li>Create a <strong>gallery</strong> that displays multiple images, and show off your best photos.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the flipside, bolding too many things creates visual confusion:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  <strong>What can you do with this block?</strong> Lots of things!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try adding a <strong>quote</strong>. Sometimes someone else said things best!</li>\n<li>Use it to highlight a <strong>link</strong> you love\u2014sharing <strong>links</strong> is the currency of the internet.</li>\n<li>Create a <strong>gallery</strong> that displays <strong>multiple images</strong>, and show off your best <strong>photos</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When lists are short and basic, don&#8217;t bother\u2014bolding just adds busy-ness.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What can you do with this block? Lots of things!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a <strong>quote</strong>.</li>\n<li>Highlight a <strong>link</strong>.</li>\n<li>Display multiple <strong>images</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The lack of words creates its own focus; you don&#8217;t have to add any more.</p>\n<h2>UI Descriptions</h2>\n<p>Guidelines for writing one-line feature descriptions, or short descriptions to clarify options.</p>\n<h4>ONE: Clarity above all!</h4>\n<p>If the user doesn&#8217;t understand what using a particular option will result in, it doesn&#8217;t matter how clever your pun is. Wordplay and idioms are frequently unclear, and easily misunderstood. If you use them at all, they should be as supplemental information\u2014 never to explain the main idea\u2014and they should be something you\u2019re fairly certain will be understandable to a pretty wide range of people.</p>\n<h4>TWO: Refer back to section one, and look out for those bulk-adding phrases.</h4>\n<p>Active voice is typically the better way to go, and cutting out the bulky phrasing is particularly important when you\u2019ve got limited space and you need people to be able to make decisions and act. Often you can shorten a UI instruction phrase to be both shorter and clearer:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  When you click X, Y happens.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>vs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Click X to do Y.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>While it can feel like adding the extra words helps walk a user through the product, the extra words just serve to obscure the point being communicated:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  When you click the \u201csettings\u201d button, the pop-up will display the advanced settings that are available.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>vs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Click \u201csettings\u201d to access the advanced settings.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Similar phrases are \u201cOnce you do X\u2026\u201d or \u201cIf you want to do X\u2026\u201d Sometimes there are decision points where \u201cIf you want to do X\u2026\u201d is entirely appropriate because there are different paths the user can take based on their goal. But, we often use it to mean \u201cHere is a thing you can do,\u201d which you can express more simply as: \u201cTo do X\u2026\u201d</p>\n<h4>THREE: Be specific.</h4>\n<p>When an action depends on the user having completed some prior action, be specific about what\u2019s required and what happens next. We often default to \u201cwhen you\u2019re ready.\u201d<br />\nReady for what? Be specific about whatever the prerequisites are.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready\u201d can mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you want to add another block\u201d</li>\n<li>When you\u2019re satisfied with your post\u201d</li>\n<li>After you\u2019ve finished proofreading your post\u201d</li>\n<li>When you\u2019d like to add a featured image\u201d</li>\n<li>After you\u2019ve configured all the settings\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And when something means everything, it actually means nothing. The more specific instructions are, the more useful they are, and the more trust the person following them will have in the product.</p>\n<h4>FOUR: This is still writing. It should have personality and interest.</h4>\n<p>Clarity above all, yes, and space is often limited here\u2014but UI text can still be interesting to read.</p>\n<p>Single lines of description can still be complete sentences.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  List. Numbered or bulleted.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>vs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Add a list, either numbered or bulleted.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can still use contractions.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Add a list. We will provide formatting options.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>vs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Add a bulleted list\u2014we\u2019ll give you some formatting options.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can still use punctuation\u2014em dashes, colons, semicolons\u2014to control the flow of your words, link ideas, and create pauses.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  List. Numbered or bulleted.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>vs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Add a list\u2014numbered or bulleted. Your choice!\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can still try to avoid jargon in favor of plain language.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Add unordered or ordered list.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>vs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Add a list, either numbered or bulleted.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>(And because it bears repeating: no wordplay, please! \u201cPersonality\u201d can\u2014and in UI instructions, should\u2014be subtle. We\u2019re talking about text that sounds like it was said by a human being, not forced attempts at whimsy.)</p>\n<h4>FIVE: Pay attention to capitalization.</h4>\n<p>When it comes to headlines and subheads, there are two ways to capitalize:</p>\n<p>In Title Case, the First Letter of Almost Every Word Is Capitalized</p>\n<p>In sentence case, only the first letter of the line is capitalized</p>\n<p>Feature names and dashboard sections typically use title case (think \u201cSite Stats\u201d or \u201cRecently Published\u201d), whereas feature labels typically use sentence case (like \u201cShow buttons on\u201d or \u201cComment Likes are,\u201d where \u201cLikes\u201d is capitalized because it\u2019s the feature name, but the overall label is using sentence case).</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re looking at a full page of UI copy, make sure you\u2019re being consistent across all of it, and that all similar kinds of copy\u2014headlines, tooltips, buttons, etc.\u2014are using the same case.</p>\n<h2>Error Messaging</h2>\n<p>Guidelines for writing error messages that are understandable and useful.</p>\n<h4>ONE: Don\u2019t ignore voice/tone in error messaging\u2014they communicate a lot.</h4>\n<p>Voice and tone can say as much as the individual words themselves. Error messages have to convey a significant amount of information and usually need to be fairly short, but try not to sacrifice tone, or to go too far in either a negative or positive direction.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say someone\u2019s trying to publish a post, but their user role doesn\u2019t allow them to do that. Here are some ways we could\u2014but should not\u2014communicate that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Your user role is incorrect.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here, we sound distant and uncaring.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Stop! You do not have permission to do this.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here, we sound unnecessarily alarmist and stern.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Oopsie, we can\u2019t let you do that!\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here, we sound too cute.</p>\n<p>We can stay direct, positive, and friendly, even in error messages. How? With tips two through four!</p>\n<h4>TWO: Whenever possible, offer a path to resolution.</h4>\n<p>A good error message doesn\u2019t just alert someone to the fact that something is wrong.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Your user role is incorrect.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Okay, fine. Why does that matter? What do I do about it? How does this message help me? I need to know why my user role matters, and how to get the role I need so I can complete the action I want to complete. An error message that doesn\u2019t provide any instruction leaves the user without a path forward; they can\u2019t avoid repeating the action that led to the error if we don\u2019t tell them now.</p>\n<h4>THREE: Don\u2019t lean on jargon to cut down on words when space is tight.</h4>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Your user role is incorrect. Contact a site administrator.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Maybe we\u2019re getting somewhere here: now I know there\u2019s something I can do about things, which is good.</p>\n<p>Then again, maybe we\u2019re not: I still don\u2019t know what my role is, or why it matters. Also, now I\u2019m not sure what a site administrator is, who mine is, or how to contact them.</p>\n<p>All the information in this error message is technically entirely correct, but that doesn\u2019t mean it communicates anything useful. If the goal is understanding and resolution, technical accuracy doesn\u2019t always get us there.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour account does not have permission to publish posts\u201d doesn\u2019t use the language of the user roles UI, but it does explain what\u2019s gone wrong and I can understand it even if I don\u2019t know what a user role is. And since I understand, I\u2019m also better placed to understand the resolution, even if the message ended here: I can see that I need to get permission.</p>\n<p>Consistency with existing UI language is great, but not when it gets in the way of understanding.</p>\n<h4>FOUR: Don\u2019t assume people understand where the error came from.</h4>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Your user role is incorrect.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It might seem obvious to us that the user got this message when they tried to publish something or change a setting that they don\u2019t have permission for. It might not be so obvious to the user: people click around a lot, especially when we\u2019re unsure how to do something, and we don\u2019t always remember what page or setting we were just looking at (or why!).</p>\n<p>A good error message also includes some context that orients the user. \u201cYour account does not have permission to publish posts\u201d reminds them that they were trying to publish a post, and that that\u2019s the particular stumbling block that caused the error.</p>\n",
