        "rendered": "<p>The Theme refers to the underlying technologies and components that come together to deliver the visual design and functionality of a WordPress website. It encompasses the server-side components that power WordPress, as well as the architecture and files specific to WordPress themes.</p>\n<p>Understanding the technology behind WordPress themes on the server is fundamental to building and maintaining successful WordPress websites. Whether you&#8217;re a developer, designer, or administrator, this knowledge empowers you to create and manage themes effectively, ensuring a secure, high-performing, and visually appealing web presence.</p>\n<h2>Technology of Themes</h2>\n<h3>Web Servers</h3>\n<p>Web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx) handle incoming HTTP requests and serve web pages. They play a critical role in delivering WordPress themes to users.</p>\n<h3>PHP</h3>\n<p>PHP is the server-side scripting language that WordPress is built upon. It processes requests, connects to the database, and generates dynamic content based on theme files and user input.</p>\n<h3>Databases</h3>\n<p>WordPress relies on databases, typically MySQL, to store content, settings, and theme data. It retrieves information from the database to dynamically generate web pages.</p>\n<h3>File Systems</h3>\n<p>File systems are used to store theme files, images, JavaScript, and CSS. Understanding the structure and organization of theme files is essential for theme development.</p>\n<h2>Theme Architecture</h2>\n<p>WordPress themes consist of PHP template files, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and other assets. Themes are organized within the <code>wp-content/themes</code> directory on the server.</p>\n<p>Template files determine the layout and structure of web pages. Key templates include <code>header.php</code>, <code>footer.php</code>, and various content-specific templates like <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>.</p>\n<h3>Style Sheets (CSS)</h3>\n<p>CSS files control the visual presentation of the theme. Styles are defined in CSS files and determine elements like colors, fonts, and layout.</p>\n<h3>JavaScript</h3>\n<p>JavaScript files enhance website interactivity and functionality. These files can be included in themes for tasks like form validation, animations, and AJAX functionality.</p>\n<h3>Functions.php</h3>\n<p>The <code>functions.php</code> file contains PHP functions and code for theme-specific features and customizations. It&#8217;s where you can add actions, filters, and custom functions to modify how the theme behaves.</p>\n<h2>Workflow on your Webserver</h2>\n<h3>User Requests</h3>\n<p>When a user visits a WordPress site, the web server processes their request and forwards it to WordPress.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Core</h3>\n<p>WordPress core, which includes PHP scripts and database queries, interprets the user&#8217;s request and retrieves content and settings.</p>\n<h3>Theme Integration</h3>\n<p>The selected theme&#8217;s template files and styles are integrated into the content, and the final HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are generated and sent to the user&#8217;s browser.</p>\n<h2>Customization and Optimization</h2>\n<h3>Child Themes</h3>\n<p>Child themes are used to extend and customize existing themes without modifying the original theme files. This allows you to make changes without losing updates or risking theme conflicts.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<p>Optimizing themes for performance includes minimizing server requests, reducing image sizes, and optimizing CSS and JavaScript. Caching techniques can also enhance loading speed.</p>\n<h3>Security Considerations</h3>\n<p>Proper security practices include keeping themes and WordPress core up-to-date, securing database access, and sanitizing user input to prevent vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>2023-11-06: Added Update Theme Informationen.</li>\n<li>2022-08-16: Nothing here, yet.</li>\n</ul>\n",
